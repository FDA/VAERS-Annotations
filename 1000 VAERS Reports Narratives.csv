Annual follow-up states the pt has metabolic disturbances, mitochondrial problems, GI issues, PDD. Pt is now a 3 year, 9 month old child with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder/Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Pt has been referred for a neurological consultation by his pediatrician. Pt was seen previously for a neurologial examination in June of 1998. He returns today to review his developemental and neurological status, to examine his educational and therapeutic interventions and to determine whether any adjustments or amendments need to be made in his overall program plan. Pt was accompanied to this assessment by his parents who provided much of the background information. Currently, pt has now gotton some words and is trying to imitate sounds made by others. His parents are pleased that he is now making more of an effort, whereas before he simply became frustrated. Words which he tends to use with some reasonable consistency include mam, go, bye, and dada. He has also learned to shake his head yes or no appropriately and is developing the use of the ""H"" constanant sounds. He currently recognizes 19 letters, all of his shapes and colors and he is currently working on generalization and can point to shapes in a book. Play skills have like wise improved as has eye contact. He has a tendency to become fixated on the same four viseo tapes but rarely asks for television.

Papular erythema, pain in both hands, chronic illness. Annual follow - up states the pt occassionally experiences papulo-pustular lesions and also a papular rash. A follow up report received 6/12/2000 adds: Pt reports info given in box 18 was in error. The generalized pruritis occurred on 11/14/1999 and lasted approx 3 weeks. He was given Varivax ""as a precaution"" after exposure to a pt with sore throat and ""weird type"" lymph nodes who later developed chicken pox-like rash. ""There was no time to do a titer"" so Varivax given to this physician. A ""few days"" after the Varivax both the pt and his wife, an ICU nurse, developed ""weird rashes"". The rash abated, but in February he developed pain in left arm and 2 weeks later itching. A ""lymphatic cord"" was noted in left arm and mild ""chickenpox lesions"". In late February he developed a rash on his hands and peeling goes to the present. Intermittent appearance of papular rash on his back and aches and pains in medial aspect of arms (lsp left) and thighs. Aches and pains temporarily relieved with aspirin. Also has tried acyclovir x 2 which ""helped rash temporarily"". The ""cord"" in left arm was diagnosed as ulnar entrapment neuropathy"" and is ""probably coincidental"". Pt consulted with a doctor at CDC who stated there some similar reports. He also spoke with Merck who offered to biopsy lesions, but none are vesicular at present. Pt will fax and mail a complete progress note and lab test results currently available."

He appeared to have a chill. At 1:00 on 2/16/99, the pt's temperature was 39.3 degrees. The pt was prescribed cold cataplasm and cefalexin during a visit to the ER. That day, the fever was in the range of 38 degrees. In the morning on 2/17/99, the fever was 37 degrees. In the evening, the temperature decreased to the 36 degree range. On 2/18/99, the pt experienced worsening of congestive heart failure with dyspnea. On 2/19/99, his body weight increased to 60 kg from 58.5 kg in spite of the fact that he had controlled body weight at 58.5 with use of a diuretic drug and restriction of water intake. Swelling of the liver and dyspnea also appeared. He was treated with IV injection of furosemide and increase of the dosage of oral diuretic. On 2/20/99, his body weight decreased to 58.5 and dyspnea improved. On 2/22/99, the dosage of oral diuretic was returned. Subsequently, the pt recovered from the symptoms. The reporting physician felt that the symptoms were related to the vax. The reporting physician felt the worsening of the congestive heart failure was a significant medical event. The physician also felt the fever by vaccine may have worsened the congestive heart failure. The follow-up received on 09/28/2001 states that this report was in a published article that an adult pt with chronic heart failure and at high risk for infection was vaccinated with a dose of pneumococcal vaccine 23 polyvalent. The pt developed a reaction requiring immediate medical therapy and complained of severe heart failure symptoms after vaccination. This pt was part of a study involving 430 adult pts between the ages of 30 and 99. Co-morbid conditions, among the 430 participants, included ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, post-cardiac surgery, arrythmias/cardiac pacing, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, cogenital heart disease, COPD and"
152506-1,"Information has been received from a foreign legal firm concerning a 14 month old male infant who, post vax, he had a 5 word vocabulary at age 2 and at that time he appeared to lose the speech he had gained. He was noted not to be affectionate and had poor concentration. When he was 3, his attention span was short but he developed a fixation with tractors and diggers. He went through a period of insisting to be dressed in blue and became anxious if his hands were sticky. He was dx'd with global developmental delay. His mom felt uneasy with this dx, subsequently, he was dx'd with autistic symptoms or Asperger's syndrome by an educational psycologist. The mom raised the possibility of being damaged by the MMR vaccine but the pt received another dose in late 1994 or early 1995. The psychologist noted echolalia and disinterest in surroundings while paying attention to details. He also had obsessional behavior and upon internal review, autism, attention deficit disorder, developmental delay, febrile seizure, and seizure were considered other medical events. No further info is available. All available medical records will be provided upon request. Follow-up received on 07/28/2001 indicated that within 3 hrs post vaccination, the pt developed a temp and his sleep pattern was disrupted. Within 2 days, he eveloped bowel problems and frequent diarrhea which persisted for 2 months. Within 5-8 weeks post vaccination, the pt developed a number of colds, had difficulty eating lumpy foods and started to drool excessively. At 2 months post vaccination, he lost the ablity to feed himself. At 3 months post vaccination, the pt developed an abnormal thirst, a gait disturbance and hypersensitive hearing. At 9 months post vaccination, the pt lost a number of single words he previously acquired, became hyperactive, laughed inappropriately, stopped using eye contact, had poorer social skills, developed a number of obsessive routines such as twiddling blocks in his hands and close to his eyes, stopped using pretend play, would often stare into space, developed temper tantrums, balance problems worsened and made strange wailing and screeching noises. At 20 months post vaccination and 3 years of age, the pt started calling his parents by their first names, took statements literally and developed behavior composed of fixed routines and ritualistic patterns. Subsequently, the pt's social behavior did not progress substantially and his developmental delay worsened over time. On 07/29/1999, a child and adolescent psychiatrist dx'd th pt with general developmental delay, significant continuing articulation difficulties and with poor oral control and dribbling, clumsiness and delayed motor control. Further, while the pt did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for autism, he had behaviors and interest which might fall within the autistic spectrum. Attempts to toilet train the pt at 18 months and 2 1/2 years of age failed and he would suffer from diarrhea every 2 weeks and thereafter, with bouts of fluctuating constipation. The pt did toilet train by the age of 5. Upon internal review, autism, febrile seizure, and seizure were  considered other medical events. No further info is available. This is an amended report. The age of the pt now reads 14 months instead of approx. 11 years and the narrative now reads 14 months instead of approx. 11 months. The following were considered to be incidental findings: upper and lower respiratory infections, gait abnormality, hyperacusis, salivation increased, sleep apnea and thirst increased. All available medical records will be provided upon request."

History of present liiness: Pt is a 23 month old little boy who s being seen for his initial evaluation through the clinic because of concerns about development. Parents report that they felt that pt's development was okay up until he was apprx. 15 months old. They report that at 14 to 15 months, pt was saying a few words such as, mama, dada, ball, and oh oh. He was interactive and would play patty cake. At about 15 months of age, they noticed that he seemed to lose words, stopped talking, and did not babble as much. He became less responsive to his name and would not come when called. He started toe walking and jumping alot. His eye contact decreased and he seemed less socially interactive. He was no longer very interested in people. He also became less interested in toys. Parents noticed that he was doing more blank staring. He quit imitating things. This past February, pt was seen by MD for a neurology evaluation. He had an abnormal EEG, although apparently it did not suggeste a clear cut seizure disorder. MD suggested, but parents opted not to start pt on medication right away. They report that pt is scheduled to have a repeat EEG next month. Pt also has a history of chronic diarrhea. MD ordered in abdominal x-ray and diagnosed constipation. He explained to parents that he felt the loose stool was actually leaking around compacted stool. He suggested they try giving pt Milk of Magnesia, mineral oil, or enemas. Parents report that pt has a long history of having watery stools. They report that the last few days, pt'a stools have been more formed, although they are not sure why. The parents have also pursued other treatments for pt.

Also, within a few weeks, post vax, the pt developed various infections of the ear, throat, and chest. Finally, the pt was dx'd with autism. Upon internal review, autism was considered to be ""an important medical event."" His exams clearly came within the dx of autism. We felt he demonstrated repetitive and absorbing interests, used his visual skills better than auditory ones, was fascinated by words, displayed little self-help behavior or pretend play and has a deviant pattern for feeding. His language is disordered with minimal understanding of speech, and a need for contextural and situational cues or gesture in order to make appropriate response. We indicated that he will likely always have communication difficulties within the autistic spectrum and that appropriate educational input was absolutely vital. His developmental progress first concerned parents around 18 to 22 months of age. His progress before this was normal with independent walking by 13 months and 2 words by fifteen months. He was a happy and affectionate baby. F/U 1/19/98 the pt was seen by a pediatrician.She noted that the parents became concerned about their son's progress round about 18-22 months. at the time of the visit it was indicated that the pt still required some help with dressing himself.

The convulsions followed a pattern that occurred without warning. He would fall to the floor and have a generalized tonic-clonic seizure involving the whole body. His hands become clenched and twisted and the episodes last for about two minutes. He settles after rectal administration of diazepam (Valium) by his parents. During his nocturnal seizure the night before the clinic visit, the muscle of the left side of his face seemed distorted. Following the seizures, he is very irritable for an hour before falling asleep for an additional hour. Upon waking, he seems to be 'back to normal'. The physician felt that the only thing to be done was to 'gradually work through the available antiepileptic drugs'. A CT scan and EEG were"

Immediately, post vax, the pt experienced a high temperature with diarrhea and ""sickness"" which lasted for 1 week. On 7/25/92, the pt was taken to his physician with a cough. It was noted that the child's condition deteriorated gradually after the vaccination. Within 1-2 months, he had bouts of diarrhea which cleared up and had a loss of interest in playing with his sister and other children. Within 2-3 months, he had a loss of response to his name. By 9 months, post vax, he had a loss of speech development, hand flapping and echocoliac speech. In 10/94, the pt was dx'd with Autism. Upon internal review, Autism was considered an ""Other Important Medical Event"". Additional information is expected. F/U this is an ammended report. The fill number for the lot has been added. Additional info is expected. This was the only info rec'd with this follow up. F/U states that he is still not very reliable as far as his bowels are concerned. It was reported that he had hearing tests all of which he passed. In summary, it was felt that the pt was overall delayed for his age but had mare delay in understanding of speech and language. His communication skills were poor as was his eye contact. Vaccine history included a 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose of diphtheria toxoid (+) pertussis vaccine (+) poliovirus vaccine (+) tetanus toxoid on 6/20/91, 7/24/91 and 8/28/91, respectively and a dose of Hib (lot L0137151) on 3/25/93."

This report was received from the regulatory authority. Current medical conditions included a grippal infection with rhinitis at the time of the vaccination with Twinrix. No concurrent medications were reported. After previous vaccinations (e.g. Polio) the vaccinee usually felt ill. On 11/16/00, the vaccinee received the first Twinrix adult (hepatitis A and B vaccine). According to the vaccinee, one and a half days post vaccination, on 11/17/00 she experienced pain and weakness in her injection arm (left arm). Approximately one and a half weeks she experienced an increased atonia of her left arm and a numbness sensation in her left arm, left side of the face and breast, according to the patient exactly until to the median line. According to the vaccinee's internist, where the vaccinee was on 12/07/00, the vaccinee's shoulder-neck muscles were hardened since approximately two weeks after the vaccination. A computed nuclear spin resonance tomography of the cervical spine performed on 12/14/00 revealed  an advanced osteochondrosis C5 to C7 with dilation of spinal column and no prolapse of intervertebral disk, protrusion D7/8 (?). On 12/18/00 the vaccinee went to the neurologist. The vaccinee reported to the neurologist that she had been suffering from pain in her left shoulder since two weeks after vaccination. A paresis of the upper left plexus brachialis was detected. Form 12/19/00 until 12/22/00 the patient was hospitalized where a neuragic amytrophy of the shoulder was diagnosed.

175764-1,"A 14 month old male, on 09/13/93 was vaccinated with one dose of Measles virus vaccine live (+) Mump virus vaccine live (+) rubella virus vaccine live. On approximately 09/13/93 the patient developed a slight temperature, was crying a lot, and was not his usual self. Within  8-12 weeks, in approximately 11/93, the patient's demeanour had altered and his personality was noted to have changed. On 01/20/94, it was noted that his speech was not progressing and that he still only used three words. On approximately the same date, he developed constipation which resulted in visits to the physician. ON 11/13/95, he was referred to a psychotherapist due to chronic constipation. In 11/96, the patient was noted to have bowel movements every five days and""seemingly failed to respond to treatment"". When he did have a bowel movement, ""he would be in a lot of pain and started to vomit"". It was reported that prior to having a bowel movement, he would be in pain. His behavior deteriorated and he became aggressive and inconsolable. On 01/27/97, the patient ""was suffering"" from overflow diarrhea and an x-ray revealed ""masses of feces"". The patient also developed increased thirst, altered sleeping pattern, and night sweats, on unspecified dates, post-vaccination. It was noted that the patient did not receive any other vaccination containing Measles, Mumps, Rubella or have a known Measles, Mumps, Rubella infection. It was also noted that two months after birth, the patient suffered from ""choking attacks"". A pediatrician saw him at 4 months of age and felt that the choking attacks were ""probably convulsions in disguise"". Phenobarbitone was prescribed and then discontinued 9 months later, as the condition resolved with no further problems noted. Follow up information indicated that the patient was born full term following a normal vaginal delivery, he had slight meconium stained liquor but did not have any particular perinatal problems. It was reported that he had breathing difficulties as an infant and was operated on for a hydrocele in approximately June 1994 and this event delayed his toilet training. Because of the breathing anxieties, the patient's mother has kept a close watch on him at night. It was reported that both his parents were well and there was no family history of epilepsy. The patient was seen on 12/18/95 by a physician who reported that with medication the patient was no longer constipated and passes a motion without discomfort more or less every day. The physician reported that his conclusion was that the patient does have control over his defecation, in that he knows when he wants to go and will delay going (within reason) until the circumstances are right for him. The only problem from his parent's point of view is that this is a nappy rather than a pot or toilet. Follow up information was received from a physician who saw the patient on 7/25/96. He reported that the patient was a 4 year old boy who has apparently been constipated since birth. His bowel moves only at a rate of once every 5 days. He was previously treated with lactulose 30ml twice a day and failed to respond to it. Upon examination he looked healthy and was in a reasonable state. His abdomen showed no palpable colon and no signs of fecal matter collection. The physician wondered whether his condition was compatible with congenital megacolon. Follow up information received from a correspondence dated 10/17/97 indicated that the patient was going to be seen by a pediatrician for urianry incontinence and bowel problems. It was reported that the patient's mother was worried about the relation of his constipation to the MMR (second generation) that was given to he at about 1 year of age. THe patient's mother suspected Crohn's Disease being responsible and that was induced by the MMR and the pediatrician explained to the patient's mother that diarrhea is the more usual symptom of Crohn's disease rather than constipation.

For 5 of them, the dx of Typhoid fever was confirmed on blood culture. For the others, the dx was not confirmed at the time of the report but they all presented with the same clinical signs. All the soldiers had been vaccinated within the 5 years preceding the onset of Typhoid fever. All pts were recovered at the time of the report (10/19/01) but duration of symptoms were not reported. After questioning of the soldiers, the suspect food was found to be a cucumber salad eaten on 8/14/01. Among the 49 persons exposed, 24 men developed Typhoid fever (among them 1 was vaccinated with Typherix, other manufacturer, the 23 others were vaccinated with Typhim VI. Only 5 blood cultures could be performed (because there was not enough material to perform them in all pts) and were positive for Salmonella Typhi. The other cases (with no blood culture performed), were considered as strongly probable cases of Typhoid fever because of the similar symptoms. The mean latency of onset of symptoms was 24 days. The mean temperature was 40.2C. All pts were hospitalized, treated with ofloxacin and recovered (duration not reported). Pt #9: False Typhoid Vaccine Failure: 30 year old man, vaccinated with Typhoid vaccine on 10/14/97, 4 years before onset of symptoms. To be noticed that army recommendation is to re-vaccinate soldiers every 5 years (not consistent with French official recommendation: every 3 years). According to this data, an analysis was performed: the mean period between vaccination and date of onset of symptoms (9/01) was longer in infected pts than in non-infected pts. The risk was multiplied by 4.4 in the pts vaccinated since more than 3 years compared to pts vaccinated since less than 3 years. File to be complete.

The consciousness of the pt became impaired, therefore, she was taken to the hospital. In the hospital, the pt was given midazolam, IM and was then discharged. On 11/4/01, a few hours later, the pt experienced seizures again, accompanied by foaming of the mouth and urinary incontinence. The pt was hospitalized again. At the time of hospitalization, the pt was in the state of coma. Physical exam revealed reaction to pain, spontaneous nystagmus, low muscle tone, no stiff neck, moderate reflexes, equal pupils reacting to light and normal vegetative parameters. The dx was encephalomyelitis. On 11/4/01, the pt was placed on therapy with glycerin, ceftriaxone, aminophenazone, acyclovir and dexamethasone. Subsequently, on 11/7/01, the pt recovered from coma. Some days later, the pt recovered from encephalomyelitis. On 11/16/01, the pt was discharged from the hospital. Neurological exam and EEG confirmed the recovery, sequelae are not expected. The reporter felt that coma and encephalomyelitis were related to therapy with MMRII. Coma and encephalomyelitis were considered to be immediately life-threatening.

This eruption evolved with successive outbreaks for 6 months after which it completely and spontaneously disappeared without any sequelae. In Jan 97, she developed lower back pain, pain in buttocks and later in shoulders irradiating to the upper limbs. The pain was of imflammatory type and there was no fever. In Sep 97, in addition to these pains, she developed proximal muscular weakness. Biological work-up retrieved a moderate inflammatory syndrome (ESR 15 mm/h, CRP 2 mg/l, orosomucoid 0.84 g/l, haptoglobin 1.49 g/l, alpha2 globulin 13 g/l). Other parameters (muscular enzymes, thyroid work-up, completements, antinuclear factors and rheumatoid factors) were within normal ranges. Because of the inefficacy of NSAID, she received a short corticotherapy (Betamethasone 10 mg/d for 8 days) which led to a spectacular relief of symptoms. In Nov 97, she was referred to a specialist because of diffuse myalgia and proximal muscular weakness; a diagnosis of rhizomelic pseudopolyarthritis was made. A Horton disease was discarded. Subsequently, a corticotherapy with 30 md/d dosis of Prednisone was initiated. All the pains regressed within 48 hours and in Jun 98, the rhizomelic pseudopolyarthritis was well under control with Prednisone (10mg/d).

He spent 5 days in the hosptial and after discharge he suffered with no further symptoms of this nature subsequent to this operation. After the pt returned home following the vaccination, he devleoped a slight temperature and was given Calpal and he remained unsettled for the next 48 hrs. Within 6 weeks of receiving the vaccination he stopped responding to verbal instructions, to which he did previously respond. He also became very withdrawn and would not interat with other people. At the same time he also became frustrated at small things and would scream and wriggle to avoid any contact with anyone, and also had severe bouts of diarrhea which would occur about 10 times daily. He screamed as though he was in immense pain during these bouts. In October 1994 this was investigated at the hospital but they could not find the cause of the diarrhea. Two months after the vaccination (11/27/94) he became rigid in his play and obsessive over certain toys. He appeared to be completely cut off from the world around him. He also lost all of his previously acquired words prior to the vaccination and had problems holding a pen. In approximately the end of January 1995, he began flapping his hands, lining up cars and rewinding videos. In early 1995 the health visitor referred him for audiology assessments and speech and language therapy. In the summer of 1995 he was investigated for his diarrhea at a hospital. A colonoscopy was recommended, however, the mother did not want"

It is alleged that following the vaccination, the patient developed autism and bowel problems. It was noted that the patient's maternal grandfather suffered from irritable bowel syndrome. On 5/4/95, immediately following the vaccination, the patient appeared drowsy distant and irritable. The patient was uncharacteristically silent and lost his speech that he attained prior to vaccination. The patient's eye contact had disappeared almost immediately. Within days of the vaccination, the patient appeared uninterested, oblivious to his surroundings and was very insular. At around the same time, the patient lost his previously tolerant nature and began to complain in many situations. Also very soon after the vaccination, the patient lost his previously tolerant nature and began to complain in many situations. Also very soon after the vaccination, the patient adopted a very regimented, inflexible and obsessive approach to his play, diet and behavior that thereafter continued in this manner. On 6/12/95, just over a month after vaccination, the patient suffered from diarrhea and vomiting. The patient's diarrhea remained a regular problem until the introduction of a controlled diet. Approximately one month after the vaccination, the patient's obsessive nature was continuing to develop and he could not tolerate any changes to his routine. The patient also developed an aversion to certain types of fabrics, sleeves, and collars on clothes. Clothes of the wrong type caused him to display a tantrum, hitting himself for example. By 2 months after the vaccination, the patient's motor skills had regressed to such an extent that he was no longer able to pull himself to stand or walk. At the same time, although the patient had regained around one or two words, he was only reacting to certain sounds."

The event occurred during a study conducted between 1998 and 2001, financed by foreign authorities concerning sudden infant deaths following vaccination. Details regarding anamnesis were missing. Only information received was that there was no mention of a history of convulsions. On an unknown date, the subject received a dose of both diphtheria tetanus pertussis poliomyelitis/haemophilus influenzae B vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine. Twelve or less days post vaccination, the subject suddenly died. Information received did not report the subject to show brain edema. The reporting physician and especially the leader of the study centre, who was in contact to the vaccinating pediatrician, did not consider the death of the subject to be related to vaccination with diphtheria tetanus pertussis poliomyelitis haemophilus influenzae b vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine. Hence this case has not formally been reported to the foreign regulatory authority. However, since there is a contact between the reporting physician and the PEI is aware of the number of lethal cases occurring in this study. For the time being, details have not been exchanged because of the missing consent of the parents. However, further information has been requested.

Titers are lower than expected for a fully immunized child. The reported cause of death was Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. The child had received Prevnar vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The fourth dose was not given.  Nurse follow up on 09/07/04 states: ""Complete.""  Follow up on 09/10/04 states: ""The cause of the death of pt, was an infection around the brain with Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacteria commonly found in the nose and air passages and a frequent cause of meningitis in this age group. There is no evidence of significant trauma.  Toxicology showed nothing abnormal."""

227416-1,"This case was reported by a physician and described the occurrence of shoulder muscle atrophy in a 39 year old female subject who was vaccinated with hepatitis A-B vaccine for prophylaxis. The subject's medical history including flooding of the cellar in 2003 and repeated travel to a developing country. It was unknown how many doses of hepatitis A-B vaccine the subject received previously. On an unknown date the subject received another dose of hepatitis A-B vaccine at a unknown application site. On an unknown date post vaccination, in summer 2004, the subject developed a first epicondylitis and later on neuritis and myositia. In the meantime, the subject has become unable to work as teacher due to shoulder muscle atrophy on the right side. The events were considered to be clinically significant and shoulder muscle atrophy was disabling (OMIC). Cerebrospinal fluid examination, performed on 9/24/04, was normal. Shoulder muscle atrophy was not resolved. On 13Sep04 magnetic resonance tomogram (MRT) was performed, but the results were not reported. On 16Sep04 the subject was examined by a neurologist. Severe pain improved. The subject was hospitalized on 24Sep04 in a neurological dept. The pt was treated with high dose prednisolone (Decortin H) since 25Sep04. The outcome of the events was UNK. The reporting physician considered that neuritis of the plexus was probably related to vaccination with hep AB vaccine.  Follow up on 11/02/04 states: ""In the meantime the subject claimed damages for postvaccinal injury."" 60 Day follow up: Case still under investigation. Per follow up report received on 08/19/2005:  The patient's recovery status is still unknown."
228267-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of cellulitis in a 50-day-old female subject who had received diphtheria tetanus and pertussis DTP (A or W not known) injection for prophylaxis. This girl was born at full term by uneventful delivery. Her birth weight was 3500g. The girl was previously healthy and exclusively breastfed. The history of vitamin K administered at birth was unknown. There was reportedly no umbilical bleeding. Co-suspect vaccines included a dose of bacillus Camette Guerin vaccine. Concomitant vaccine included a dose of oral polio vaccine. This subject received a dose of DTP (A or W not known), a dose of oral polio vaccine and a dose of BCG vaccine. During the night after vaccination, she developed fever and later experienced generalized convulsions for 30 seconds. She was not further investigated by the local physicians since vaccination had been cited for the convulsion. Two days after vaccination, she developed profound bruise and edema on the right hand. She was seen by a physician and followed up with a diagnosis of localized trauma without any intervention. On the follow up, since her edema and ecchymosis were worsening, she was referred to a hospital with a presumed diagnosis of gangrenous cellulitis. There was no documented bleeding diathesis history in the family. Laboratory investigations revealed coagulopathy as follows: international normalized ratio (INR) (normal range, 0.75 - 1.50) and inactivated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (normal range, 29-47) were over the range of laboratory limits (laboratory upper limits 10 and 180 respectively). Factor XIII and fibrinogen levels were within normal limits. The patient also suffered anemia: hemoglobin concentration of 7.7 g.dl, hematocrit 22%. The platelet number checked for hemorrhage etiology was normal 415000/mm3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 32 U/L and total direct bilirubin levels were within normal limits (1.24 mg/dl and 0.24 mg/dl respectively). Cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple intracerebral hemorrhages. Bleeding as a result of vitamin K deficiency was suspected. She was hospitalized, received 3mg vitamin K IV and was transfused with a packed erythrocyte suspensions and fresh frozen plasma. After this therapeutic approach, control laboratory investigation revealed INR and aPTT within normal limits; 1.19 and 31.7 seconds, respectively, and no convulsion was seen during the follow up period. It was recommended that primary immunization be completed under the supervision of immunization experts. The author said that ""In this case, convulsion might have been the result of either intracranial hemorrhage or the pertussis component of DTP vaccine side effect. In our opinion, injection induced stress might result in the intracranial hemorrhage that caused the convulsion in this infant."
232732-1,"A 64 year old female pt experienced nausea, malaise, neurological problems including slurred speech, slow thinking, trouble driving, inability to integrate traffic signals, feeling like she was drunk, and sleepiness at work. She also experienced vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, not being able to eat, and itching in the abdominal area, after being treated with RabAvert for post exposure prophylaxis after being bitten by a raccoon. She received five injections of RabAvert from June03 to Jul03, with the last one given 4 to 10 days late. The pt's medical history was significant for acute pancreatitis on approx 14Dec03, for which she was hospitalized for 4.5 days, and a history of triglycerides 17 times the normal range. Concomitant medications included Gemfibrozil. On 20Jun03, approx 2 days after the first injection of RabAvert, the pt experienced nausea, malaise, neurological problems including slurred speech, trouble driving, inability to integrate traffic signals, feeling like she was drunk, slow thinking and sleepiness at work. She also experienced vomiting, diarrhea, weakness and not being able to eat. In mid-July she experienced itching in the abdominal area. The symptoms lasted through mid Oct2003. The pt reported feeling better after that but still tired. Follow up received on 13Aug04: the pt was bitten by a young raccoon on 13Jun03. The dates of the RabAvert injections were provided. All of the reported events had resolved except for the high triglyceride levels that continued to be 17 times the normal. Follow up information received on 18Aug04: the pt was placed on seven days of Ciprofloxacin in May04 for post surgery prophylaxis. The RabAvert injections were on 17Jun03, 20Jun03, 24Jun03, 02Jul03 and 18Jul03. The triglyceride level increased from 2200 mg/dl on 17Jul04 to 3,518 mg/dl on 24Jul04 and remained elevated. The reporter thinks that the high triglyceride level is related to the RabAvert injections because all of her triglyceride results prior to the RabAvert injections were normal. No triglyceride testing was done after the RabAvert injections until June 2004. The results were reported in July04. Follow up information received on 20Sep04: Although the pt was hospitalized for 4.5 days for acute pancreatitis, the pt had a history of pancreatitis and this was considered a flare-up of her pre-existing condition. Her triglycerides returned to normal and all other symptoms resolved."

234826-1,"This case was initially received on 3/1/05. This is a literature case. This case concerns a 32 year old female patient. The patient received typhoid vaccine, batch number not reported, manufacturer unknown, and hepatitis A vaccine, manufacturer unknown, batch number not reported, on an unspecified date during 2002. Four days following vaccination, on an unspecified date, the patient experienced malaise, and pain, erythema and swelling of the right shin, of such severity that she required a crutch to walk. Her GP had diagnosed this as cellulitis and treated with oral antibiotics and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The patient's symptoms improved, although the severe leg pain persisted. After experiencing these symptoms for three weeks, the patient presented at her local hospital, on 7/31/02. The patient then developed 2 erythema nodosum-like lesions, one on the forearm and one below the right knee. She had severe arthralgia in the right wrist and both knees and ankles. This was diagnosed as post-streptococcal erythema nodosum, as the anti-streptolysin O titre was 800IU/ml. She was treated with penicillin and prednisolone, 40mg daily. This provided an initial improvement, but following discharge, she complained of severe immobility and mottling of the skin of the lower extremities. Prednisolone was then discontinued and within days, multiple painful erythematous lesions appeared on all four limbs, associated with apin and swelling of the wrists and left elbow. In addition, she developed severe buccal cavity ulceration as well as generalized weakness, malaise, abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss. She was transferred to a rheumatology unit on 8/23/02 The patient had a temperature of 38 degrees C, 2 oral ulcers without genital ulceration and multiple tender SC nodules of the upper limbs. See lab comments for test results. Following admission, her condition worsened. Over the next 5 days she was febrile, with temperature up to 39 degrees C. She developed further red, tender palpable skin lesions affecting face, hands, wrists and lower limbs, all of which rapidly became bullous or pustular in appearance, some of which ulcerated. It was felt that represented bullous pyoderma gangrenosum. There was synovitis in multiple joints and dactylitis (with both synovitis and tenosynovitis) affecting all toes and most fingers and worsening oral ulceration. She developed a painful, red right eye. She required large doses of opiod analgesia to control her symptoms. See lab comments for repeat testing. Scleritis of the eye was diagnosed by the ophthalmology service. Slip lamp examination was delayed for several weeks after high dose steroids were commenced because the patient's degree of debility was such that she could not sit in front of the slit lamp. However, when the examination was eventually performed, no evidence of uveitis or retinal vasculitis was detected. The patient was treated with corticosteroid eye drops, Dapsone 100mg daily, colchicine 0.5mg BID, and prednisolone 120mg daily. Although there was some improvement over the next two weeks with fever settling and ESR and CRP decreasing, new skin lesions were still appearing. As her steroid dose was gradually reduced, dapsone was discontinued due to the development of methaemoglobinaemia and abnormal liver function tests. Mycophenolate mofetil was commenced instead. She continued to improve slowly and her oral ulcers and cutaneous ulcers healed and the scleritis resolved. The ESR and CRP normalized approximately 6 weeks after starting steroids. After the diagnosis of Behcet's syndrome, the patient was also given Azathioprine. Liver function test abnormalities resolved. Pain and mobility improved slowly with physiotherapy and analgesics were slowly weaned. The patient returned to work and medication was tapered to prednisolone 3mg daily, AZA 50mg daily, and MMF. Following a reduction of the MMF dose to 500mg BID in March 2004, she developed a recurrence of symptoms of oral u"

245444-1,"After getting a company work assignment, my wife and I purchased the current flu vaccinations from a local drugstore.    Three days later, at 3:00 A.M., I was awakened by extreme pain in my neck.  The pain was such that I could not move, even the slightest, as even a movement tiny as a hair would create super intense pain in my neck.  Actually, it was a bit frightening because of not being able to move; even the tiniest movement brought excruciating pain to my neck.  After a time the intenseness subsided, however, the next few days movement in my neck was restricted by pain.  To this day (4 years later) I do not have the free neck movement I enjoyed prior to this experience.  A few months later I went to a dermatologist to check on some red blotches in different areas of my body.  I had had these skin blotches for many years without knowing what they were.  The dermatologist took one look and advised me I have eczema.  He gave me some topical cream to apply to the blotches.  A few days later in discussing this event - flu shot with eczema - a colleague at work described a similar situation with one of his family members.  He said they were advised to never get another flu shot again as it could be severe the next time.  Since that event in 2001, I have discontinued getting flu  shots for fear of re-experiencing such intense pain in my nect again in addition to fear of losing move free movement in my neck.  I do not know the specifics about the vaccine, i.e., manufacturer, type, or even the nurses who gave the shots.    I only submit this in order to help others with similar eczema symptoms as well as seeking information so that I may avoid similar experiences in the future."

The subject received intramuscular investigational product single dose on 2/17/2005. Site of injection was the left deltoid. On 2/17/2005, the subject received the 1st intramuscular injection of blinded study vaccine in the left deltoid. The subject had been randomized to receive the active control in this trial, an investigational formulation of Havrix vaccine containing 720 ELISA units of hepatitis A antigen and 500 ug A1 (OH) 3.

On 4/19/2005, 61 days after the 1st dose of investigational product, she experienced vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. She presented to the local clinic where a blood pregnancy test was found to be negative. She was referred to the gynecology service at the local hospital. A new blood pregnancy test proved to be positive. A pelvic ultrasound was performed and revealed a missed miscarriage. On 4/19/2005, she was hospitalized and diagnosed with missed miscarriage at 16.3 weeks gestational age. Laboratory tests unspecified done on 4/22/2005 was normal. The subject underwent therapy with Oxytocin from 4/21/2005 to 4/25/2005 because the cervix remained closed and formed. On 4/26/2005, dilation and curettage was performed without complications. The events resolved on 4/27/2005 after nine days and she was discharged. She experienced some light lumbar pain on the day of discharge, but by the next day, she was asymptomatic with no vaginal bleeding. Biopsy report from 5/3/2005 revealed placental detritus. As a result of the event, the subject was not to receive further doses of the investigational product, but was to continue in the study three months after the delivery date. This event had been considered to be medically important (OMIC). The investigator considered there was no reasonable possibility that the missed miscarriage may have been caused by investigational product. Follow up received on 4/3/2006: following a request, the investigators and medical monitors redefined the criteria of temporal association between vaccination and adverse events related to pregnancies. Therefore, the investigator will consider like possibly related those pregnancy related events from women whose date of last menses occurred within two months after vaccination. The missed miscarriage had been reported as non related and according to the new criteria the investigator changed the relation of the event as possibly related to study vaccine."

In 1997, the subject received two doses of Engerix B pediatric (10 mcg, unknown batch reference). In 1997, a few days after the second injection of Engerix B, the subject developed partial epilepsy. The subject was treated with lamotrigine (Lamictal) and propranolol hydrochloride (Avlocardyl). It was reported that at the time of reporting, epilepsy was well controlled for three years. In September 2005, serology evidenced negative anti-HBs antibody. In October 2006, the subject received a 3rd dose of GenHevac B, unknown batch reference). The day after the injection, the subject experienced partial epilepsy crisis during two to three days and then resolved. In November 2006, one month after the third injection of hepatitis B vaccine, anti-HBs antibody remained negative. The physician considered the partial epilepsy was probably related to vaccination with Engerix B pediatric. Follow-up information received on 04 December 2006: In 1997, due to the partial epilepsy, the subject initiated valproate sodium (Tegretol) which was discontinued due to unspecified toxicoderma. Then, she received valproate sodium (Depakine) and clobazam (Urbanyl) following by a treatment with lamotrigine (Lamictal) associated with propranolol hydrochloride (Avlocardyl) for the stress. In November 2006, as antiHBs antibody remained negative, she received a fourth injection of GenHevac, unspecified batch reference). Before and after the injection, the subject received clonazepam (Rivotril). No relapse of partial epilepsy was then noted. An antiHBs serology was planned in December 2006. Follow-up information received on 06 July 2007: The subject did not take epileptogenic drugs. She had no relevant past medical history, including no convulsive crisis, no abnormal movements, no cranial trauma, no CNS disorders, no neurological congenital abnormality, no renal insufficiency and no drug or alcohol abuse. Partial epilepsy of arm was followed by loss of consciousness. Investigational check-up confirmed epilepsy without organic etiology found. There was no hydroelectrolyte disorders and no sign of lesion or infection of nervous system, which could have caused the crisis. Partial epilepsy was unresolved at the time of reporting and almost certainly related to Engerix B and GenHevac B vaccine. This case was assessed as serious by GSK.

334844-1,"Information has been received from a published article, title as stated above, from a physician concerning a 3 year old male (case patient 5) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who was vaccinated with VARIVAX (Merck). This report was part of a post-marketing surveillance program describing the outbreak of varicella with likely breakthrough disease in a population of pediatric cancer patients receiving cancer treatment in a healthcare setting with an affiliated group housing facility. In October 2004, approximately 7 days after identification of the index subject, the subject presented with vesicular, crusted lesions on his scalp and shoulders. His lesions tested positive for VZV by fluorescent antibody test. The subject was exposed to varicella through the index subject who had been living in the same housing facility. Subsequently, the subject was admitted to the hospital and given acyclovir therapy. It was reported that the subject had documented VZV antibody titer prior to exposure, considering likely breakthrough disease (defined as varicella with onset at least 42 days after vaccination). The subject did not experience medical complications related to varicella. At this time, relationship of breakthrough varicella to study therapy is unknown. Results of the study revealed that in approximately 16 days, varicella had been detected in 7 children (the index case, 5 secondary cases and 1 tertiary case). Of the 7 identified cases, 4 appeared to be cases of breakthrough disease in previously vaccinated children. The outbreak resulted in the exposure of 82 families at a pediatric group housing facility, 28 children at the schoolroom and 77 patients, 150 family members, and 9 staff members at 3 outpatient clinics. The study highlights the important role that breakthrough varicella can play in healthcare centers with affiliated group housing. Formal recommendations on the management of exposed individuals who have been vaccinated should be made aware in such settings, especially if immunocompromised hosts are present."

On examination, he was febrile, had mild nuchal rigidity, and exhibited unsustained horizontal nystagmus on left gaze, discrete left arm dysmetria, bilateral symmetric lower extremity paresis, patellar and ankle hyperreflexia, and impaired sensation to light-touch and pinpick with an ill defined sensory level around T9. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord showed areas of high signal intensity on T2 weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) in the middle cerebellar penduncle, right dorsal medulla oblongata and a multilevel lesion involving the thoracic spinal cord with subtle patchy heterogeneous enhancement after administration of gadolinium. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed clear and colorless fluid with a normal opening pressure. Cell count was elevated with 62 white blood cells (neutrophils 41%, lymphocytes 46%, monocytes 13%) 17 red blood cells, glucose 54 mg/100mL (serum glucose 154 mg/100mL) and a protein content of 105 mg/dL. CSF cultures were negative. Serum and CSF evaluations for herpes simples virus type 1 and 2, epstein barr virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus type 6, enterovirus, human deficiency virus, human T-lymphocytic virus 1 and 2, rabies virus, arbovirus barthonella quintana, rickettsiae, brucella spp, leptospiras, salmonella, borrelias, myobacterias, treponema pallidum, plasmodium, cryptococcus and myoplasma were negative. CSF myelin basic protein (MBP) was elevated with a level of 618 ng/mL. CSF total IgG level, and IgG index were normal. CSF specific IgM antibodies to YEL levels were elevated with a level of 15.6, IgM and IgG specific antibodies to YEL levels in serum were 4.8 and 1.4 respectively (normal is less than 2.0). The patient received a five-day course of 1 gram daily of intravenous methylprednisolone, with marked clinical improvement. MRI of brain and entire spine showed resolution of previous lesions 30 days after initiation of therapy.""

374627-1,"A 60 year old male, was admitted from the Clinic on 17Dec09 for progressively-worsening upper and lower extremity weakness. The patient has a glomus tumor at the base of the skull and a history of non-Hodgkins lymphoma in the past.  He received seasonal influenza immunization 10/02/2009: Vaccine:  Influenza  0.5 ml (IM)          Site: Left deltoid         Manufacturer:    CSL Biotherapie          Lot #:     08049111A          Expiration Date:     Jun 30,2010  No evidence that the patient received the H1N1 novel or  swine   flu vaccine.  We are currently attempting to determine whether or not the patient received the H1N1 vaccine from a community source.  He was subsequently admitted on 28Oct09 with history of possible TIA.  At that time, he reported shooting pains in the right lower extremity for 6 weeks  duration, with acute onset of numbness in the right upper extremity, particularly the medial forearm and 4/5 digits.  In addition, he stated he noted numbness in the right face and right thigh, but denied dysarthria, weakness otherwise, or gait disturbance.  He was discharged on 28Oct09 without a definitive diagnosis having been made.    The patient had symptoms in the interval from 28Oct to 17Dec.  The symptoms gradually worsened and on admission he had right-sided paresis with reflexes brisk on the right and normal on left.  A lumbar puncture revealed significantly elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein, which is typically indicative of an inflammatory/immunologic reaction in the spinal meninges or spinal nerves which can be consistent with several conditions.  The clinical picture in this case includes Guillain-Barre Syndrome which has been reported as a rare adverse reaction from the seasonal and the  swine  H1N1 influenza or vaccination for those conditions, and also as a parA-neoplastic syndrome associated with the immunologic disorders related to ongoing cancerous processes or the direct physical effects of tumor masses on the nervous system.   The non-Hodgkins lymphoma, the glomus tumor, and/or either the seasonal or the H1N1 vaccine could be etiologic to a GBS-like syndrome."
375016-1,"I received the Guardasil shot series over the course of 6 months. After the first shot given in  May, I was nauseous and vomited. I also developed severe facial acne that I'm still experiencing, two weeks after the first shot.  I don't remember any problems after the second shot in August. Severe symptoms started on the evening the third shot was administered December 14, 2009. I had constant tingling in my right limbs (arm, all the way down to the tips of my fingers, and leg, from the knee down to the foot): the shot was given in my right arm. I was still able to walk and use my arm. It was not a sharp pain, just constant. By Thursday, Dec. 17 at 4 A.M., the tingling was prevalent in all my limbs and my feet felt numb. I went to the emergency room on Thursday, Dec. 17, 3 days after the shot as the tingling was worse and not subsiding. They ran a CT scan to rule out shunt problems since I have a VP shunt.  All was fine with the shunt. On Friday Dec. 18, I went to another emergency room so I could be evaluated by a neurologist. He ran reflex tests and everything was working well.  He diagnosed neuropathy and said he thought it would eventually subside.  That night I experienced swimming vision for a few minutes and a headache. I had trouble sleeping each night, unable to get comfortable in bed; the tingling seemed to be worse when lying down. The next day I felt dizzy, had an intermittent headache, and experienced vision problems if there were bright lights.  By Sunday, the symptoms became less severe and over the course of the next week, diminished completely."

Concurrent medical conditions included aortic stenosis and pulmonary fibrosis. Concurrent medications included alendronate sodium, acetylcysteine, SENDOXAN, prednisolone, LASIX, spironolactone and CALCICHEW-D3. On 9 November 2009, the subject received 1st dose of PANDEMRIX H1N1 (unknown route and injection site, batch number not provided). At an unknown moment after 1st vaccination of PANDEMRIX, the subject felt infected but it was transient. On 16 December 2009, the subject received 2nd dose of PANDEMRIX H1N1 (intramuscular, unknown injection site, batch number not provided) and unspecified dose of FLUARIX (unknown route and injection site, batch number not provided). A few days later the patient felt that the respiration gradually deteriorated. She came to hospital on 27 December 2009 with severely affected breathing. Tests were performed : pulse oximeter (POX) 50-70%, increasing to 85-90% on 4 liters of oxygen. Pulmonary X-ray showed fibrosis where consolidation could not be excluded. The patient was nursed initially at ICU, without respirator treatment. She was given treatment with cefotaxime and high-dose cortisone. CRP was measured : 91 (<5 mg / L) when admitted, two days later increased to a maximum of 186 and then decreased gradually to 20. The patient still required oxygen treatment. She was discharged to home on 18 January. At that time she presented tachypnoeic and weakness but was eager to go home. She was given oxygen treatment at home. On 26 January 2010, There was a sudden worsening of breathing. When the ambulance arrived the patient showed severe respiratory distress, had cyanotic on the lips and was discretely marbled on the underside of the thighs. Tests : POX 29%, respiratory rate 35-40. Upon arrival at the emergency room somewhat improved oxygen saturation, POX 50-60%. Abdominal respiration. Blood gas showed signs of carbon dioxide retention with pCO2 6.9 (4.4 - 6.0 kPa) and PO2 5.0 (10.6 - 13.8 kPa). Received VENTOLINE, ATROVENT, and BETAPRED. She was admitted to the ICU and was given antibiotics and cortisone. She did not tolerate CPAP-treatment (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) so she was given high doses of oxygen via mask. There was a deterioration during the day. It was decided that further ICU treatment was not appropriate, was moved to the ward. There was further deterioration in the evening of 27 January 2010. She was Unconscious. The subject died on 28 January 2010 from unknown cause of death. It was unknown whether an autopsy was performed."
382783-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of bullous pemphigoid in a 8-week-old female subject who was vaccinated with DTPa-IPV-HIB (manufacturer unspecified). On an unspecified date the subject received 1st dose of DTPa-IPV-HIB (unknown). One week after vaccination with DTPa-IPV-HIB, the subject presented blisters. The subject was referred at the age of 10 weeks with a 2-week history of vesicles and blisters on her palms and soles. The subject's brother and grandmother had recently been treated for impetigo and in view of this, the paediatricians made a provisional diagnosis of bullous impetigo and started her on intravenous AUGMENTIN and gentamicin. On physical examination, the subject was found to be alert and apyrexial. She had crusted and haemorrhagic vesicles and bullae of differing sizes on acral areas. Erythematous, urticarial annular plaques were present on her scalp, trunk and inner thighs. Scarring, milia and Nikolsky_s sign were absent. The child had peripheral blood leucocytosis (21.9 ? 10^9 /L; normal range 4-11) with eosinophilia (19%; normal range 1-4) and thrombocytosis (1031 10^9/L; normal range 150-400). Histological examination of a skin biopsy showed an intact subepidermal blister containing fibrin, neutrophils and eosinophils.  Direct immunofluorescence showed strong linear staining of the basement membrane zone for IgG and C3 but no staining for IgA and IgM. Indirect immunofluorescence showed IgG antibodies against the BMZ in a linear pattern at a titre of 1 : 20. IgG was bound to the roof in salt-split skin, supporting a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. Antibiotics were discontinued, and after initial improvement with fusidic acid 2% and betamethasone 0.1% cream, but new blisters appeared. Oral prednisolone 1 mg/ kg/day treatment was started with good initial response. One month later, the subject's conditions were deteriorated, with extensive involvement of the scalp, trunk, periorbital and genital areas. Mucous membranes were unaffected. Therefore Prednisolone was increased to 2 mg/kg/day but blisters continued to develop. On review 3 weeks later, clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment and oral erythromycin 35 mg/kg/day were added. This combination resulted in complete resolution of the blisters within 2 weeks. Prednisolone was slowly tapered off at 0.5 mg per week over 6 months. Oral erythromycin and clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment were discontinued 6 weeks later. The disease was still in remission at follow-up 1 month after all treatment had ceased. It was unlikely that the vaccine provoked the development of autoantibodies because of the short onset of BP following vaccination; it was suggested that the administration of the vaccine unmasks sub clinical BP by inducing a nonspecific immune reactivation in genetically predisposed individuals. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK."

On 9 and 10 November 2009 at the hospital, the neurological examination showed an acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis which had progressed since the control in September 2009. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was started and the patient was referred to hospital for follow-up treatment. The muscle strength in legs weakened and the patient experienced numbness of feet. Despite of the treatment, the symptoms progressed and the patient was referred back to hospital for plasmapheresis. On 11 November 2009, the symptoms worsened and the respiratory rate increased. During the evening, the level of consciousness decreased and breathing difficulties and carbon dioxide narcosis were diagnosed. The subject was transferred to the intensive care unit for a respiratory treatment where he was intubated. C-reactive protein had increased and pneumonia was diagnosed. Bronchial aspirate sample from the intubation tube showed alpha hemolytic streptococcus +++. Influenza virus Nh0 was negative whereas Influenza H1N1 variant Nh0 examination was not performed. Antibiotic treatment was started. The subject had 5 times plasmapheresis. On 16 November 2009, he was tracheostomised. The subject was treated in the intensive care unit at the hospital from 11 November to 19 November 2009. After that he was transferred to the central hospital at the intensive care ward. Hemorrhage occurred as a complication of tracheostomy. The thorax x-ray performed showed that the left lung was completely opaque. On 5 December 2009, the bronchoscopy was performed at the hospital. The subject had coagulated blood especially on the right side of bronchus. On the left side, the coagulated blood had completely blocked the bronchus. On 6 December 2009, the subject was transferred back to the hospital because the removal of the coagulated blood was unsuccessful. At hospital, the coagulated blood was removed.

It was reported that one month later the patient received the vaccine, she complained of pain in the right knee and neck, a rash and a low-grade fever and saw the physician. Three theories were reported by the physician in this case to describe patient's autoimmune process to explain the reaction to the vaccine. The physician reported that the vaccine whose purpose was to enhance the immune reaction but, in this case, overstimulated it, and failed to develop antibodies to the vaccine but still reacted to the shot. The physician's preferred diagnosis for the patient was nonspecific arthritis, an undefined connective tissue disease, He also mentioned that patient had seronegative rheumatoid arthritis because of the absence of positive rheumatoid factor, or ""epitope spreading"" where the immune system developed autoantibodies or antibodies toward a part of molecule in the vaccine that was similar to the individual's own body, in this case the enzyme polymerase. The special master reported that all of those mentioned theories by the physician were plausible. Another physician reported that patient had elevated white blood count (WBC) but was not sure of the significance of the elevated WBC. The patient's outcome was unknown.

390200-1,"Background: A foreign HPV vaccination program commenced in May 2007 for females aged 12-26 years. Syncope and syncopal seizures can occur with any painful stimulus. High rates of both have been documented post GARDASIL vaccination. Aim: To describe cases of 'syncope' and 'seizures' post GARDASIL vaccination notified to SAEFVIC. Methods: All reports of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) received by SAEFVIC between May 2007 - April 2009 were selected for analysis. AEFI following GARDASIL vaccine coded as seizure or syncope were reviewed. Results: During the study period, 6% (9711653) of all SAEFVIC reports met the criteria: afebrile seizures (3), syncopal seizures (31) and syncope alone (63). Median age at vaccination was 15 yrs (range 8-30 years). 23% (7131) of syncopal seizures had associated urinary incontinence. An injury was sustained in seven cases, including one vertebral (T5TT6) fracture. After clinical review, further GARDASIL vaccine doses were given under supervision whilst lying down for 20 minutes to 21 women with no recurrences. The rate of syncopal seizures was 2.6 per 100,000 doses of GARDASIL vaccine distributed. Conclusion: A high rate of syncope and syncopal seizures was seen post GARDASIL vaccination in one location. Clinical follow-up allows for clarification of the diagnosis, a physical examination and investigations as appropriate. Effective strategies to minimize the risk of recurrent syncope post vaccination include lying down before and 20 minute post vaccination. Upon internal review T5/T6 vertebral fracture was considered to be an other important medical event. Attempts are being made to identify the additional patients in this abstract. Additional information has been requested."

This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event was unspecified. This case is one of the 11 cases (B0643778A, B0667867A, B0667865A B0667866A, B0667868A, B0667869A, B0667870A, B0667867, B0667872A and B0667873A) described in the literature article and classified as 'new onset of chronic illness'. The case referred to 52 subjects who onset asthma. This literature article summarizes the results of an open, prospective, observational study that was carried out in a Health Maintenance Organization. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of specific categories of adverse events (medically attended neurologic and hematologic events, allergic reactions and new onset of chronic illnesses) following administration of a single dose of BOOSTRIX (GlaxoSmithKline) to adolescents in a postlicensure setting. The study monitored safety outcomes among 13,427 10 to 18-year-old adolescents who received TDAP vaccination as part of their normal health care. The subjects were evaluated using self-control analysis comparing days 0 to 29 to days 30 to 59 post-vaccination for neurological events, hematological events and allergic reactions. Furthermore the study evaluated new onset chronic illnesses within 6 months of TDAP vaccination by comparing with historical TD controls matched for age at vaccination, season, sex, and geographic area. The study also compared the incidence of events of interest between the TDAP and historical cohorts as exploratory analyses. The study showed no increased risk for medically attended neurological or allergic reactions following TDAP vaccination when comparing the first 30 postvaccination days to the second 30 postvaccination days. There was one hematologic event within 30 days of TDAP, compared with 0 events within days 30 to 59. When compared with matched historical TD recipients, no increase in new onset chronic illnesses was seen after TDAP. No deaths occurred in the TDAP cohort during the study. In conclusion, this study provided no evidence for an increased risk for neurological, hematological, allergic events, or new onset of chronic illnesses among adolescents vaccinated with TDAP."

Information regarding PREVENAR was received from a healthcare professional via a foreign regulatory authority regarding a 5-month-old male patient who experienced suspected fever, interstitial lymphocytic pneumonia, lymphocytic myocarditis, grumbling and sudden infant death. The patient received the first dose on 07-Jun-2010. 07-Jun-2010, the patient was well and physical examination was normal before vaccination. On 07-Jun-2010 in the evening, the patient was grumbling and he was found warm. Despite body temperature was not measured, fever was suspected and the patient was given one suppository of DOLIPRANE (dose unknown). The patient had not presented any further event during the night. On 08-Jun-2010 in the morning the patient was well. At 08:00 am, he was given his bottle feeding; he drank well and his behaviour was normal. At 10:30 am, he slept in his baby-carriage in semi-sit position. At 11:40 am, he was still in the same semi-sit position, but was cyanosed, dead-still, areactive and very hypotonic. When the emergency staff arrived, the patient was in cardio-circulatory arrest and had bloody serosity in nose. The patient unsuccessfully received cardiac resuscitation. He was diagnosed with sudden death while taking a nap at his wet-nurse home. Autopsy was performed on 10-Jun-2010, which found no signs of trauma and no cardiac malformation. Upper airways were free. Histology of lungs found some intra-alveolar oedema and presence of interstitial lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate and some foci of food inhalation without contact inflammatory reaction. Moderate lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate was found on the proximal bronchi; examination of the heart showed presence of several foci of interstitial lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate of myocardium, sometimes accompanied by necrosis of cardiomyocytes. No viral inclusion. Focal myocardial fibres of ischemic aspect were also found of non-systematic repartition. These cardiac lesions showed histological aspect of lymphocytic myocarditis. By conclusion of the autopsy, the patient was found to have viral-type inflammatory lesions in the upper airways and in myocardium, so that diagnosis of interstitial lymphocytic pneumonia and lymphocytic myocarditis were done. These lesions could have been responsible for the patient's death since they were susceptible to generate cardiac rhythm disorders. Results of histology were suggestive of viral origin. However, routine examinations found no virus including no Respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza virus, Para-influenza virus, Adenovirus or Enterovirus. The cause of death was reported as sudden infant death syndrome and the autopsy cause of death was myocarditis and interstitial lung disease. No additional information was available at the time of this report."

413899-1,"Initial literature report received on 20 Dec 2010: This report consisted of cases retrieved from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program database. A query of the database was conducted to identify potentially relevant cases based on a claimed injury of shoulder pain, arm pain, shoulder dysfunction, frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis, or shoulder bursitis. Brachial neuritis was also included since this injury was frequently claimed when the arm was involved regardless of the actual diagnosis. Case histories of all submitted medical records were reviewed in detail to verify vaccination date, symptom onset and clinical course. This patient with no history of shoulder dysfunction, was vaccinated with influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown, batch number: unknown) on unknown date. It was reported that the vaccine administration led to shoulder injury with significant shoulder pain and dysfunction. The symptoms lasted for more than six months. The outcome was not reported. The authors commented that they believe that this type of phenomenon is not due to a specific vaccine but results from injection of a vaccine antigen to which a person has previously been sensitized as a result of previous naturally occurring infection or past vaccination. This concept is consistent with the vaccines which were given in this case series, namely influenza and tetanus vaccines which are given repeatedly over time. This clinical case series provides additional evidence supporting the report that vaccine administration in the upper third of the deltoid area can have long-lasting consequences unrelated to the specific vaccine administered."

The discharge diagnosis was acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (onset date 19 Jan 2011 and completely recovered by 25 Jan 2011). The investigator suspected a possible relationship between the acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with the study vaccine. In the absence of the investigator's causality assessment for hypertensive cardiopathy, Novartis has processed the case as suspected for reporting purposes. Following internal review on 14 Feb 2011, it was noted that the investigator's causality was incorrectly reported on the initial case as not suspected; the investigator causality was possibly related to the study vaccine."

422917-1,"Initial report received from a healthcare professional from the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation, on 09 May 2011. It pertains to 1 of 6 patients, described by the reporter in a literature article, who experienced adverse events following vaccination. The article describes 13 patients; 6 were identified as having received sanofi pasteur products, 4 received products from other manufacturers, and 3 received products from unknown manufacturers. The events for the other 5 patients who received sanofi pasteur products are captured in case numbers 2011-02687, 2011-02688, 2011-02689, 2011-02690, and 2011-02691. The 3 patients who received products from unknown manufacturers are unidentified; information for those 3 patients is captured in 2011-00466. Abstract: ""Shoulder pain is a common transient side-effect of vaccination. Infrequently, patients can develop prolonged shoulder pain and dysfunction following vaccination. A series of 13 cases are described in which persistent shoulder dysfunction and pain developed following immunization. Common clinical characteristics include absence of a history of prior shoulder dysfunction, previous exposure to vaccine administered, rapid onset of pain, and limited range of motion. The proposed mechanism of injury is the unintentional injection of antigenic material into synovial tissues resulting in an immune-mediated inflammatory reaction. Careful consideration should be given to appropriate injection technique when administering intramuscular vaccinations to reduce the risk of shoulder injury."" All individuals in the case series were adults, and 85% were women. With one exception, all received either influenza or a tetanus-containing vaccine prior to the onset of symptoms. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.2 (range 19.4 - 41.3). Shoulder pain was present in all patients, with onset occurring less than 24 hours after vaccination in 93% and immediately following injection in 54%; in addition, 46% reported concerns regarding vaccine administration, specifically that the vaccine had been administered ""too high"" in the deltoid. The most common findings were limited and painful range of motion. None of the 39% of patients who underwent electrodiagnostic studies had findings suggestive of a neurological disorder. MRI findings included fluid collections in the deep deltoid or overlying the rotator cuff tendons, bursitis, fluid ""greater than typically seen"" within the bursa, tendonitis, rotator cuff tears, and (in one patient) subchondral changes in the humerus with overlying severe tendonitis and fluid accumulation. Severity and duration of shoulder dysfunction varied, with more than half requiring at least one injection of a corticosteroid. Surgical intervention was performed in 31%, with half of those requiring a second surgical intervention. All patients had symptoms for at least 6 months, with some cases persisting for many years. A   [Due to memory limitations, the remainder of this text could not be compared.]  9-year-old female received a left arm injection of FLUZONE SV '2005-'2006 on an unspecified date (lot reported as V1839AA, not a valid lot number; U1839AA is a valid sanofi pasteur lot number). Immediately following vaccination, she reported pain in the shoulder, arm, and hand: limitation of range of motion of the shoulder due to pain; and transient subjective numbness and tingling. Weakness was not reported, or found on exam. Per the patient, ""it felt to her that the needle hit her bone"" during vaccination and that the vaccine was administered ""too high"". An x-ray of the shoulder 17 days post-vaccination was normal, and an x-ray of the cervical spine 1 week later showed C5-6 mild disk space narrowing. An EMG/NCS (electromyogram/nerve conduction study) performed 38 days post-vaccination was normal and included antidromic sensory response testing. Extension of the previous EMG/NCS was conducted several weeks later and was also normal. Appr"
423686-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of hepatitis b infection in a 26-year-old male subject who was vaccinated with Hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer unspecified). The subject's medical history included injection drug user. He had injected drugs for a short period of time at the age of 16 but he reported never sharing needles. He attended a rehabilitation program and denied injecting drug use since that time. 4 years previously, he had tested negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C. Concurrent medical conditions included alcohol consumption, marijuana and ecstasy use on occasion, smoker and tattoo. He had no sexual intercourse for 2 years. His last dental work was 5 years previously. He had not received any blood transfusions or had ever been a blood donor. He had a needlestick injury at work while cleaning out of a roof gutter. He wore protective leather gloves but after reaching into the gutter, he felt the needle of a 1.0 ml syringe penetrated the palm of his right hand. There was no plunger in the barrel of the syringe and there was no blood visible. Previous and/or concurrent vaccination included hepatitis B vaccine recombinant; manufacturer unspecified; unknown given on an unspecified date. The subject was not sure of the details. An immediate hepatitis B vaccination was recommended but he opted to have it done through his workplace. He was counselled about the risks of contracting an infection and was advised to practice safe-sex until the testing regimen was complete. All the initial serology testing was negative. 17 days after the incident, he requested hepatitis B vaccine but finally delayed the 1st dose because he felt unwell at the time. On an unspecified date, 46 days after the injury, the subject received an unspecified dose of Hepatitis B vaccine (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided). 17 days after vaccination with Hepatitis B vaccine, 63 days after the injury, the subject experienced hepatitis b injection (hepatitis B surface and ""e"" antigen positive but negative for surface and core antibodies). HIV and hepatitis C antibodies were not detected. Liver function tests were normal. In the preceding week, he reported night sweats but was otherwise well. On examination, there were no external stigmata of drug use or hepatomegaly. He had continued to work but requested sick leave to cope with his emotional disturbance. At review, 28 days after vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, the subject experienced mild, right upper quadrant tenderness and a tender palpable liver edge. Liver function tests were normal. Over the next month, he complained of tiredness, myalgias and mild right upper quadrant pain but was able to work. From 54 days to 68 days after vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, he suffered constant nausea and vomiting which was worsened by any alcohol intake. 81 days after vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, the subject had elevated bilirubin (42 umol/L), elevated alanine aminotransferase (752 U/L), elevated alkaline phosphatase (111 U/L) and elevated ggt levels (304 U/L). His hepatitis B profile was unchanged. Over the next 2 months, he returned to his normal health and 162 days after vaccination, liver function tests were normal. Hepatitis B surface and e antigen were not detected; surface antibody (29 mIU/L) and e antibody were detected. HIV and hepatitis C antibodies were not detected. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. While there was a clear temporal relation between the subject's exposure and his hepatitis B seroconversion, the authors couldn't definitely rule out another means of transmission. Sexual, medical, dental and tattoo-related transmission could be excluded but his admitted history of injecting drug use in the distant past meant that the possibility of more recent injecting drug use has to be considered. Careful examination of this possibility was undertaken by both his general practitioner and specialist phy"

At this time, I let you know that his condition worsened and that I was very concerned that patient's reaction was from the Dtap vaccination. He has not had a reaction like this since his allergies have been under control, and nothing new was introduced in his daily routine. At this time, you did not want me to think patient's reaction was from the vaccine but some other source. Friday, May 13, 2011 - patient woke up again early Friday morning having an asthma attack. I administered PRO-AIR to support his breathing. Friday morning the hives had subsided but were still present, and by Friday evening, the hives had exhibited themselves again more aggressively.

431807-1,"Case number PHHY2011LK74702 is an initial literature report received on 14 Aug 2011. The authors discussed about a case of seizures and retrograde amnesia with cerebrospinal fluid changes following H1N1 vaccination. This report refers to a 21 year old female patient. She did not have a past history or family history of seizure. She was vaccinated H1N1 (manufacturer and batch number unknown). 24 hours after vaccination she experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures which were preceded by fever, and headaches of 8 hour duration. She was drowsy on hospital admission. Her level of consciousness was reduced for the next 2 days, during which time she developed 2 further episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures. From day 4 onwards her condition improved and she was conscious, alert and seizure free by day 5. However, she continued to have a patchy retrograde amnesia, which persisted for 2 weeks. She did not have a past history or family history of seizures. There was never any neck stiffness or papilledema, she had no pyramidal, extrapyramidal, cerebellar or sensory neurological abnormalities. Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory systems and abdomen was unremarkable. She was extensively investigated. Blood sugars, serum electrolytes, calcium and magnesium were within normal limits repeatedly throughout her illness. Full blood count showed haemoglobin of 9.5 g/dl, WBC 5000/mm3 (neutrophils 53%, lymphocytes 33%) and a platelet count of 290x10^3/mm3. CT scan of the brain was unremarkable. CSF full report revealed proteins 80 mg/dl, lymphocytes 35/mm3, no polymorphs, no organisms seen. CSF culture was sterile. CSF was serologically negative for Herpes Simplex I and II, Japanese Encephalitis and Cytomegalovirus. CSF for rapid TB Culture did not show a growth of acid fast bacilli. CSF rapid antigen tests for Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumonia and Neisseria meningitides were negative. ESR was 16 mm/1 st hour, CRP was 12 mg/dl (reference 6 mg/dl). Malaria parasite was not seen in peripheral blood. Blood culture was sterile. Serum tests were negative for antiphospholipid antibodies, ANA, and anti-ds DNA. Dengue antibodies were also not detected. EEGs done for days 7 and 10 did not show any abnormality. The patient was initially treated empirically as for an infective meningoencephalitis with antimicrobials and steroids until the laboratory tests excluded a CNS infection. Antiepileptics were also commenced during the acute illness to control seizures. She made a good recovery without any permanent neurological deficits, and antiepileptics were gradually withdrawn subsequently. The author concluded that considering the history of inoculation against H1N1, 24 hours preceding the onset of seizures with CSF pleocytosis and CSF protein elevation, and with laboratory investigations excluding an alternative etiology, a causal relationship between the seizures and the vaccine was established."
434432-1,"This case was reported by a physician and described the occurrence of loss of consciousness in a  14-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with CERVARIX (GlaxoSmithKline). On 8 August 2011 the subject received unspecified dose of CERVARIX (.5 ml, intramuscular, unknown injection site). On 8 August 2011, less than one day after vaccination with CERVARIX, the subject experienced syncope and tonic convulsion. The physician considered the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention). On 8 August 2011, the events were resolved. The physician considered the events were related to vaccination with CERVARIX. Follow up information received on 7 September 2011: Concurrent medical conditions included allergy to white fish. On 8 August 2011, at 11:00, the subject received unspecified dose of CERVARIX (intramuscular, left deltoid). On 8 August 2011, immediately after the intramuscular inoculation, the subject complained of injection site pain. In 2 minutes, she fell forward to the desk for examinations. She did not respond to calls. She was kept in a supine position in a bed which was placed next to the desk and had pulse measured. The pulse was solid. Soon, clonic convulsions was started, which was not severe. The subject experienced loss of consciousness. In 1 minute and 20 seconds after the convulsion was started, the loss of consciousness resolved. She regained consciousness after 140 seconds. The physician considered the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention). Relevant test results included: Blood pressure: 99/64 mmHg. For about 40 minutes, she was laid down on bed and had blood pressure checked. On 8 August 2011, the events were resolved. The physician considered the events were related to vaccination with CERVARIX. The subject was in sitting position. The event occurred 2-3 minutes after the inoculation. The subject had a painful stimulus before the onset of the event. The subject had no predisposing factor. The subject complained of pain after the inoculation (the pain was not severe). The subject had no sign or warning regarding the episode. The subject had not sweat or warmth feeling before the event. The event developed suddenly. Two minutes after the inoculation, the patient leaned to the desk for consultation and lost consciousness. The subject's complexion and respiratory pattern were normal. The subject lost consciousness for 80 seconds. Since the patient lost consciousness, she was carried to the bed besides and was laid down. Then, the clonic convulsion was started. The clonic convulsion persisted for about 60 seconds. The subject did not fall and had no tongue biting. The event lasted 140 seconds in total. The subject did not receive any medical treatment. She was in the supine position. The blood pressure was 99/64 mmHg. The pulse was neither tachycardia nor bradycardia. The body temperature was 36.2 degrees centigrade.

The subject's medical history included examination for hepatomegaly about one year ago without pathologic findings. Concurrent medical conditions included common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), mainly with deviations concerning B-cell count and B-cell function. The subject received permanent treatment for CVID at the immunological consultation hours at a hospital. Concurrent medications included PRIVIGEN once monthly since about two years. Up to now the subject has received all recommended vaccinations. Additionally the subject was vaccinated with FSME VACCINE, H1N1 and seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. Last previous vaccination was a FSME VACCINE (other manufacturer), given on 17 May 2011. All previous vaccinations have been well tolerated. On 14 June 2011 the subject received the first dose of HAVRIX 720 JUNIOR (0.5 ml, unknown, unknown thigh). On 14 June 2011 in the evening the subject was well. Approximately 12 hours post vaccination with HAVRIX 720 JUNIOR, on the next day during breakfast, on 15 June 2011, the subject experienced refusal to eat followed by vomiting. The subject showed signs of loss of water. Post consulting a paediatrician the subject was hospitalised with exsiccosis for seven days. On admission to hospital the subject was in reduced general condition and good nutritional condition. The subject showed signs of fatigue, beginning signs of water loss including eyes with halo (sunken eyes), acidosis with bilious vomit and severe gagging during examinations. Heart and lungs were normal. Tonsillar ring showed distinct redness. Otherwise all examinations were normal. The subject has no fever; body temperature was 37.2 degC. Pharyngeal swab showed no pathogens but normal oral flora. Urinalysis was normal. Stool was positive for Rotavirus, but negative for Norovirus and Adenovirus as well as negative for TPE (typhus-parathyphus-enteritis), Shigella, Yersinia enterocolitica, pathogenic Escherichia coli and Campylobacter. Abdominal sonography, performed on 17 June 2011, showed echogenic liver with typical starry sky like imaging as seen with viral infections. No intrahepatic cholestasis or focal lesions. Gall bladder was large and clean differentiated. Spleen was borderline sized with normal echogenicity and structure and was not diagnosed as splenomegaly. Small amounts of free fluids were detected in enteric area and in minor pelvis. No detectable pathologic lymph nodes. The subject was diagnosed with Rotavirus enteritis. During course of hospitalisation the subject experienced signs of obstipation and high fever. The subject was treated with intravenous fluid(s) for fluid substitution, one dose of VOMEX suppository, MILAX suppository for signs of obstipation, antipyretic medication and, later on, CEFUROXIM for high fever and PRIVIGEN on 17 June 2011 as prophylactic immunotherapy. During course of hospitalisation the events improved increasingly. On 21 June 2011 the subject was discharged from hospital in good general condition. After about six days, on 20 June 2011, the subject recovered and all events associated with vomiting and water loss were resolved. Obstipation had already been resolved post treatment with glycerine. High fever was resolved during course of hospitalisation. At the time of reporting, on 28 August 2011, all events were completely resolved. The vaccination course with HAVRIX 720 JUNIOR was discontinued. The reporting physician considered that the events surely were unrelated to vaccination with HAVRIX 720 JUNIOR. No further information will be available."

436852-1,"Initial case retrieved from the scientific literature on 22 September 2011. The authors evaluated clinical-pathological features of 37 infants/children whose parents alleged a relationship between vaccination and death or permanent central nervous system (CNS) damage, and sought compensation through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program during the years from 1990 through 1999. CNS tissue was available for evaluation by a pediatric neuropathologist in these 37 cases: 23 males (62%) and 14 females (38%) ranging in age from 1 month to 17 years at time of death or biopsy. Thirty-three of the 37 patients were dead at the time the case was evaluated. Most commonly implicated vaccines were DTP or DTaP (33 cases), followed by MMR and IPV/OPV (25 cases each). The authors concluded that there was no obvious relationship between type of vaccine (or vaccines simultaneously administered) to time of onset of symptoms, nature of symptoms, or the lesions found. No CNS lesions were found in 5 of 37 cases. There were a variety of CNS lesions amongst the 32 remaining cases, but pathogenesis of the majority was apparent and not considered a complication of vaccination. Of the 37 patients described in the article, the vaccines received by eight of these patients were specified. This case captures one patient; and the other seven patients are captured in case numbers 2011-09242, -09243, -09245, -09246, -09247, -09248 and 2011-09250. A five-month old female infant received a DTP vaccine (manufacturer unknown, lot number, route, site and date of administration not reported) and had onset of seizures within 24 hours post-vaccination. After the seizures, the patient manifested developmental delay. Multifocal infarctions were found when she died seven years later. Documents held by sender: None."
437797-1,"Information has been received from a published literature article. Since its inception, the polyvalent vaccine against the human papilloma virus (HPV), GARDASIL, has generated some controversies as a temporal relationship between the administrations of the vaccine and the development of a few autoimmune diseases, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported. There are two cases whose initial presentation of CNS demyelination followed in close time relationship the administration of GARDASIL. The patient in this report is the first case- a 19 year old woman who received two doses of GARDASIL, 3 months apart, and approximately 1 month after the second dose, she developed numbness to the right foot that within 1 day extended to the contralateral foot and was associated with mid-thoracic back pain. Her neurological examination was only significant for the altered perception to touch to the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantar reflexes in flexion. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed a total of three lesions with characteristic demyelinating appearance, one of those in the thoracic spine was contrast-enhancing. MRI brain demonstrated one additional white matter lesion also consistent with a demyelinating process. Antinuclear antibody titres and serology for Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative; ACE levels, vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal. CSF was never tested. The patient was treated in the acute setting with high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone and clinical improvement ensued. Demyelinating disease was felt to be the likely diagnosis and approximately 4 months later treatment with natalizumab was initiated. The patient has remained clinically asymptomatic afterwards but the repeated MRI brain at 1 year showed new lesions in the white matter of both hemispheres and a small contrast enhancing area in the right frontal lobe. The patient tested positive for anti-natalizumab antibodies and the medication was discontinued. Alternative therapy for MS has been instituted. Since FDA approval in June 2006, GARDASIL has been implicated in the development of acute inflammatory polyneuropathy, MS and ADEM. It has been reported that 12 million doses of HPV vaccines have been distributed and 7802 adverse events were recorded. Of the 10 confirmed cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, five had received concurrent administration of MENACTRA. The first case reported here is concerning for causality, as no medical problems were present prior to the administration of the vaccine and the McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS are met on follow-up MRI scan. In the second case, the development of sensory symptoms approximately 3 weeks before exposure to GARDASIL poses the question of a pre-existing condition, unmasked by the trauma, reaching its full expression in coincidence with the vaccination. Administration of GARDASIL exacerbated the clinical course of three patients who had already manifested neurological symptoms consistent with clinically isolated syndrome and converted to clinically definite MS after the vaccination. A case of ADEM and MS share some pathophysiological and clinical features, it is conceivable that an immunological stimulus capable of inducing a monophasic deregulated immune response in the CNS could potentially lead to a relapsing-remitting chronic course. It is plausible that in genetically predisposed individuals, the immunological stimulus of a vaccine or even some immunomodulatory therapies may lead to a deranged immune response that could theoretically trigger an autoimmune disease. In this view, the particularly aggressive course of disease demonstrated by the patient in case No 2 could be the result of such a stimulation that could not be controlled with a firstline immunomodulatory therapy. GARDASIL has raised no concerns about the risks of transmission of the HPV and the benefits of v"

A 13 year old female patient was vaccinated on 15-SEP-11 with one dose of TRIAXIS (batch n. C3750AD) i.m. and concomitantly with one dose of MENINGITEC (Mfr. Wyeth Lederle, batch n. E63142) i.m.. On the same day, a few seconds post-vaccination, she presented with a fainting spell with clonic contractions of the upper limbs that lasted a few seconds. The patient was held for monitoring for about 30 minutes. At the time of reporting her condition had improved. The final outcome was not reported. Upon medical review the Company judged relevant to code the adverse event ""fainting spell"" which was mentioned in the narrative but not coded by HA. The case is closed. Follow-up received from HA on 29-SEP-11: the patient was diagnosed with likely emotional vasovagal reaction, complicated by clonus of the upper limbs. No further information is available. The case is closed. Follow-up received from HA on 05-OCT-11: Pre-vaccination medical history negative. TRIAXIS was administered in right deltoid and MENINGITEC in the left deltoid while the patient was seated; when shifting to the standing position the patient suddenly presented with pallor, falling to the ground (without trauma as she was promptly rescued), loss of consciousness without response to stimuli and tonic-clonic contractions to the upper limbs and face, normal breathing. The symptoms resolved after a few seconds, the patient re-gained consciousness with sufficient spatial-temporal orientation, normal breathing, slight tachycardia, normal arterial blood pressure. She was held for monitoring in the horizontal position for a few minutes and then seated; forty minutes later the patient had almost completely recovered, pallor and slight alteration still persisted but she was taken home by her mother and advised to contact her pediatrician. The following day the parents were contacted by phone and they referred that the patient had presented with slight asthenia and one episode of vomiting in the evening following vaccination, but she had regularly attended school on the following day. The patient's pediatrician confirmed of having evaluated her and finding her in good condition. An EEG was scheduled for the following weeks (results not reported). According to the reporter, the episode is to be considered as an emotionally based vaso-vagal reaction probably induced by the extreme heath and the age of the patient and complicated by brief loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic contractions. No further information is available. HA coded vasovagal reaction and clonic movements and did not upgrade the case. Upon medical internal review the case was upgraded to serious by Company. The outcome is recovered. The case is closed."

Relevant medical history included upper respiratory infection with cough and rhinitis for several days prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications were none and no past product history was reported. On 06Oct2011, in the afternoon, the patient developed fever and three suspected events of febrile seizures with myoclonus and vomiting. The patient was hospitalized and treated with infusions and antipyretics. Vomiting recurred, moreover the patient developed diarrhoea. There were no further events of seizures. Relevant lab tests included Body temperature of 39.1 C; Urine examination normal; Bacteria stool test: negative; Parasite stool test: negative and Virus stool test; negative. In addition, EEG was recommended but refused by the parents. The patient was discharged from hospital against medical advice on 08Oct2011. Clinical course from the hospital medical records was as follows: On the morning of 06Oct2011 the patient received 6-fold vaccination. During course of the afternoon the patient developed fever and the patient's mother described in this context three seizure suspected events. Two times she recognized myoclonia, especially in the area of upper extremities for a few seconds. Once the patient tonically seized out of sleeping and the patient's body was stiff and the hands were agglomerated to fists at that time. Afterwards the patient impressed as he was frightened and began to scream. No eye rolling, no increased salivation, no bedwetting occurred. In addition the patient vomited three times in the afternoon. The patient had tolerated previous vaccinations well and did suffer from rhinitis and cough in the last days and did not suffer from any pre-existing diseases. At that time the patient did not receive any medication. The patient was hospitalized on 06Oct2011 due to suspicion of febrile seizure in the case of status post 6-fold vaccination on the same day and existing infection of upper respiratory tract since a few days. At first a fluid substitution with glucose/electrolyte fluid was done in the case of mild dehydration. In addition an antipyresis was done due to continuing fever. During further course the patient showed increasing thin malodorous and decolorized diarrhea and vomited several times. Fever was well regredient and stool normalized in consistency and colour. On 08Oct2011 the patient's parents wished the advanced discharge against doctor's orders. An EEG in fever-free condition (necessary from the point of view of clinicians) was refused. The patient's parents were extensively told that at that time no sure recovering of seizure symptomatology can happen ""with the till that point done diagnostic"". As a precaution diazepam rectioles (5mg) were prescribed and the patient's parents were told what to do when the patient develops seizure again. The patient was discharged on 08Oct2011 in a stable general condition. Mentioned primary diagnosis in medical discharge record was gastroenteritis and further diagnoses were infection of upper respiratory tract and fever seizure. Follow-up activities not applicable.

They also had a low platelet count and bruising on her extremities. The patient was working with her healthcare professional to address the situation. Unknown therapy was given for the adverse event. The patient sought unspecified medical attention. Follow up information has been received from the physician and a registered physician's assistant in the form of medical records concerning a 16 year old female patient with no known drug allergy who on 14-AUG-2009 (lot # 662404/0312Y, expiration date: 30-Apr-2011), 26-JUL-2010 (666118/1539Y, expiration date: 10-Aug-2012) and 06-DEC-2010 (lot # 666596/0766Z, expiration date: 15-Oct-2012) were vaccinated intramuscularly (initially reported as subcutaneously) with the first, second and third doses of GARDASIL, respectively. The patient was also vaccinated with Hep A 1 and Tdap on (14-Aug-2009), and varicella 2 on (25-Aug-2009). The patient's concomitant medication was albuterol meter-dose inhaler as needed for the treatment of mild intermittent reactive airway disease, meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) and Hep A 2. On 14-Feb-2011, the physician reported the patient was seen in the office with a history of excessive menstrual bleeding and multiple bruises for the period since Jan-2011. The patient's history also noted petechiae and ecchymoses all over the patient's body including the face, extremities and oral mucosa. On the same day, the physician referred the patient to the hospital emergency room to rule out the diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura where the patient's history also noted heavy menstrual bleeding, weakness and fatigue. In the emergency room, the physician reported the patient's complete blood count showed a platelet count of 2,000, hemoglobin of 9 and hematocrit of 26.3, therefore the patient  was admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Upon admission, the physician reported the patient was seen in consultation by gynecology who placed the patient on birth control pills which had improved the patient's menorrhagia. The physician's assistant reported the patient was seen in consultation by hematology who recommended steroidal therapy. The patient was placed on intervenous SOLU-MEDROL 2 mg/kg/day and ZANTAC which was started in the emergency room. The treatment of WinRho was also discussed with the hematologist who did not recommend this therapy secondary to causing a possible drop in the patient's hematocrit. The hematologist recommended no treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, platelets, blood or NSAIDS but recommended APAP as needed. The hematologist recommended that the patient follow up as a out-patient on the following day. The physician's assistant discussed the hematologist's plan with the admitting physician who ordered the patient to be observed in the hospital pending the improvement of the patient's menorrhagia given the patient's low platelet count of 2,000. The physician ordered a repeat hematocrit, complete blood cell count and platelet count the following day. The hematologist recommended intravenous immunoglobulin, so the patient had received intravenous immunoglobulin 40 grams over a period of two days (dates not reported). On 19-Feb-2011, the patient's laboratory results showed a hematocrit of 26.0, platelet count of 138,000 and iron of 23. The patient had less menstrual bleeding, was not light-headed and was able to walk. The physician reported as the patient's platelet count had improved to 138,000, the patient was discharged home on 19-Feb-2011. The patient's discharge diagnosis was Evan's Syndrome.

The Foreign regulatory authority has received this case via the foreign agency. Otherwise the subject has no known underlying or concurrent medical conditions or other risk factors. Analysis of social contacts for transmissible disease was normal. The subject has received all vaccinations as recommended. The subject's medical history included swelling of legs after a previous vaccination. On 11 April 2011 the subject received the first dose of ROTARIX (1.5 ml, oral). On 16 May 2011 the subject received the second dose of ROTARIX (1.5 ml, oral). Less than one month post vaccination with ROTARIX and about five days prior to diagnosis of intussusception, on an unknown date in June 2011, the subject experience abdominal cramps with pallor with explosive defecation of thin stool in the end. Approximately 27 days post vaccination with ROTARIX, on 12 June 2011, the subject experienced mild restlessness. Approximately 28 days post vaccination with ROTARIX, on 13 June 2011 in the afternoon, the subject experienced severe colic-like pain, pallor, tremor and loud crying. On 13 June 2011 the subject also experienced for the last time stool which was reported as severe diarrhea of a bulky amount of mushy stools. The subject did not experience blood in stools, vomiting or fever. The subject was eating and drinking well. Approximately 29 days post vaccination with ROTARIX, on 14 June 2011, the subject experienced a single episode of mucus defecation. The subject was active and showed no signs of malaise. On 14 June 2011 the subject was hospitalised for three days. The reporting physician considered that the events probably had been life threatening. On admission to hospital the subject was in good general condition. The subject was awake and active. Heart and lung examinations were normal. Abdominal examinations were normal except palpable resistances in the right lower abdomen. Bowel sounds were present. Dermatologic examinations were normal. Mucous membranes were humid. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.4 mg/dl. All laboratory examinations were normal. Stool examinations showed no signs of Rotavirus or Adenovirus. Abdominal ultrasonography post hospitalisation, performed on 14 June 2011, was suspicious in the right lower abdomen. Ileocolic intussusception was suspected, but imaged cocarde-like intestinal structures were not completely conclusive. Due to lack to peristalsis conservative repositioning by hydrostatic disinvagination was followed by abdominal ultrasonography. Disinvagination was performed without complications. Ultrasonography, performed on the next day, showed thickened intestinal wall in the right lower abdomen consistent with intussusception. Clinical and ultrasonographic condition improved. Treatment with charcoal was hesitantly discontinued and oral nutrition build-up was started slowly without complications. On 16 June 2011 the subject was discharged from hospital without complaints in good medical condition for ambulatory follow-up. No further information will be available."

447494-1,"Infant had high-pitched screaming all evening/night and was inconsolable. Fever spiked to 105.7 night of vaccine administration. Infant became lethargic, glassy-eyed, appeared to be starting a seizure with unblinking stare and tongue-rolling movements although no generalized seizure activity was noted. Spoke with on-call physician 3 times that night and was advised to continue routine Tylenol and cool baths and bring infant to office in AM.  The following morning, infant was seen in Dr office where blood work was done. Was told to return to office if fever did not improve. Fever then continued to be 102 or above for 10 days following. This resulted in two more office visits where blood work, nasal cultures, xrays, and catheterization for urine cultures were completed. All tests were inconclusive. At 10 days post vaccination, fever broke.  By this time, we were having trouble bottle-feeding. Infant appeared to be unable to latch properly, would become frustrated and scream for hours. Syringe fed infant for several weeks, because she was unable to latch enough to feed completely. Multiple phone calls to office resulted in advice to ""just keep doing what you're doing."" Infant stopped lifting her head and quit rolling over or sitting - things she had been doing well prior to vaccination. Noticed that her gaze was often directed downward, and she was slow to look towards the sound of your voice. Her facial expressions were now blank most of the time, and we could no longer get her to smile frequently. She also could no longer sit without being VERY supported, whereas prior to vaccine she was close to sitting on her own. Also, began to notice when infant was lifted, she would turn her feet inward (similar to decorticate posturing). She also started having sensory issues, in such as, she could no longer sleep during the day because every little noise and light would wake her up screaming, and she could no longer soother herself. She would scream and scream until she would vomit. I STARTED swaddling, covering the windows, and using white noise to help her sleep during the day. These issues were pointed out to physician multiple times, but nothing was every done. Was told ""Sometimes, infants go through little regressions, we'll keep an eye on her."" She has had delayed development and feeding issues ever since, and has currently been scored at 6 months behind her real age. She has global hypotonia and unrefined gross/fine motor skills. She did not sit or crawl until 10.5 months. She began pulling to stand around 11 months. At 16 months, she still does not stand alone, walk, talk, or feed herself. Only with much effort have we been able to keep her from the failure-to-thrive range. She gags, vomits, and has trouble swallowing her foods. We still grind most of her foods, especially meats. Standing, crawling, and cruising along the furniture are very slow and uncoordinated. At 15 months, we finally received referrals for therapy, Neurology, and Orthopedics. Ortho has prescribed braces for her legs. Therapy is providing physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and developmental specialist. We have not yet seen Neurology to date."

455899-1,"Objective: To assess the value of retrospective hospital based surveillance to describe clinical and epidemiological features of intussusception in children aged <24 months and to investigate any temporal association between receipt of a rotavirus vaccine and intussusception. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with intussusception at a hospital over an 8-year period (01-JUL-2001 to 01-JUL-2009) including before (6 years) and after (2 years) rotavirus vaccine introduction into the National Immunisation Program, was conducted using patients identified by a medical record database. Patient profile, clinical presentation, treatment and outcome were analysed along with records of immunisation status obtained using the Foreign Childhood Immunisation Register. The medical records of all children aged <24 months admitted to the hospital over the study period with a discharge diagnosis of intussusception were obtained and systemically reviewed. Results: A total of 258 episodes of IS were identified in 230 children aged 24 months or less over the 8-year study period. Thirty-three patients were excluded from the final analysis. Final analysis was performed on the remaining 197 assessable cases. Seventy-one per cent (140 episodes) were treated successfully by air or hydrostatic enema reduction. Thirty-eight patients (19%) required surgery. At surgery, 25 patients required manual reduction only whereas 13 patients required an intestinal resection (6.7%, 95% CI 3.5%, 11.0%). Full immunisation records from the Foreign Childhood Immunisation Register were available for 174 (88%) patients. Twenty-three records were unavailable due to inaccurate or missing Medicare numbers (n = 11), overseas patients (n = 2), or the Medicare number provided returned mismatched data (n = 10). As this study period spans the period before and after the implementation of rotavirus vaccines into the National Immunisation Program, it is not surprising that only 27 patients (16%) had received at least one dose of a rotavirus vaccine. Two patients were vaccinated in the 30 days prior to diagnosis of intussusception. Discussion and conclusion: Evaluation of the safety of rotavirus vaccines, particularly with respect to the risk of intussusception, is recommended for countries planning to introduce rotavirus vaccines into the National Immunisation Program, particularly if the country was not involved the pre-licensure trials. Although the large scale clinical trials of ROTARIX and ROTATEQ did not identify an association with intussusception of the order of magnitude observed with Rotashield recent post-marketing surveillance data reported from foreign countries suggest a very small but identifiable risk of intussusception in -1 in 50,000-100,00 vaccine recipients. In the present study we accessed the Foreign Childhood Immunisation Register to assess the accuracy of immunisation data recorded in the hospital medical record and verify the vaccination status of children hospitalised for intussusception at the Hospital. Recognising that this study collected data on both before and after introduction of a rotavirus vaccine into the National Immunisation Program we have limited data on the impact of hospitalisations following administration of a rotavirus vaccine. Although 27 children with intussusception had received at least one dose of rotavirus vaccine only 2 children developed their intussusception within 30 days after administration of rotavirus vaccine. Valuable data on the incidence, clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of intussusception could be obtained from data retrieved from hospital medical records in a sentinel paediatric hospital using standardised methodology. However, there were methodological limitations and the quality of the data was highly dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the patient information recorded the system of coding and record retrieval. This report concerns a child who experienced intussusceptio"

It was reported that the man had redness and pain around the injection site the day after vaccination. At the same time he also had a mild headache that lasted until day 3. From day 3-4 the man developed a severe headache, with gradual worsening. The man was febrile, around 38 degrees Celsius, throughout December. The man sought emergency care for his headache, and was hospitalized because of headache (dates not rep) and has been on sick leave from work since, and was at the time of reporting still on sick leave. Blood samples taken; results were normal except for Alanine transaminase (ALT), no further info available. IgG and IgM measured on an unspecified date showed positive for yellow fever (source of sample (blood or CSF) was not reported). PCR was negative (source or type not specified). At the time of reporting, the outcome was not recovered. No assessment of relation with vaccination was provided by the reporter. Follow-up information was received from the Health Authority on 08-MAY-2012 under reference numbers: NO-NOMAADVRE-FHI-2012-14147, 12/825. Birth date provided. The patient was 46 years old. The patient has a history including ongoing steatosis hepatic. The patient also received an injection of IMOVAX POLIO (batch number not reported, 1 df parenteral) on 28-NOV-2011 and an injection of HepB or HepA, 1 df parenteral (manufacturer unknown, dose, route, site of administration and lot numb not reported) on 28-NOV-2011. The company considered IMOVAX POLIO and HepA or B as suspect drugs whereas HA reported them as concomitant medication. HA coded syncope (onset 01-DEC-2011) headache and body temperature increased (onset on 29-NOV-2011). The patient was hospitalized, but discharged the same day. Persisting of headache and hospitalization from 09-JAN-2012 to 19-JAN-2012, and from 22-MAR-2012 to 29-MAR-2012. Additional lab. results provided: Virus tests, Borrelia and syphilis tests, and immunological tests were negative. Lumbar puncture 28-MAR-2012 revealed increased pressure, 33 cm H2O, and slightly elevated spinal protein value: 0.67. MRcaput 18-Jan-2012 was negative, MR columna 28-Mar-2012 revealed degenerations in CT, C3/C4 level, but these degenerations cannot explain the persisting headache. UL liver/gall/pancreas 12-Jan-2012: Steatosis hepatic. Neurologic examinations 23-Mar-2012 and examinations of eyes 28-Mar-2012: No pathologic findings. Creatinine values Jan-2012: 94, 22/Mar/2012: 102 and 23/Apr/2012: 132. ALAT values: Jan-2012: 91, 22/Mar/2012: 81 and 23/Apr/2012: 53. There has been done a second opinion by a neurologist in March 2012. His conclusion is: ""This gentleman has had vaccination with the yellow fever vaccine and I think he has had a reaction in the form of mild postvaccinal encephalomyelitis from which he is recovering. Yellow fever vaccine can cause this although this is very rare."" On 28-MAR-2012, treatment with SAROTEX  was initiated. Upon medical review the company judged relevant to code the following adverse event: encephalomyelitis which was mentioned in the HA report, but not coded. HA considered the case serious due to hospitalisation and other medically important condition. At the time of reporting, the outcome was unknown for body temperature increased, not recovered for headache and recovered for syncope (date not reported). According to HA, the headache, syncope and body temperature increased was possibly related to vaccination. Other business partner  numbers include E2012-01021. No further information expected."

458212-1,"Case number PHHY2012TH053270 is an initial literature report received on 21 Jun 2012. The author discusses about the case of an adult patient who experienced life-threatening reaction to monovalent H1N1 vaccine. This report refers to a 38-years-old pregnant (gestational age of 25 weeks) female patient whose medical history, past drug, current condition and concomitant medication were not reported. She was fit and well and had regular antenatal care without any problems. She was vaccinated with H1N1 (manufacturer and batch number: not reported) through unspecified route and site on an unknown date. It was reported that the following day she developed diffuse myalgia and minimal shortness of breath. Her condition continued to deteriorate and ultimately ended in respiratory failure on day 5 post-vaccination. On arrival at the intensive care unit, she was tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Her chest film demonstrated diffuse bilateral lung infiltration. She was eventually intubated and and ventilated with high-concentration oxygen and high positive end-expiratory pressure. She was found to have bloody secretions from tracheal aspiration. Acute lung injury with pulmonary hemorrhage was therefore suspected. A complete physical examination was performed and it revealed a severe bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage. No other abnormalities were detected. Blood lab reports showed a leucopenia level of 2,600/mm3, mild anemia with hemoglobin of 10 g/dL and a platelet count of 40,000/mm3. Coagulation study performed was normal. She was also suffering from acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3 mg/dL. Urinalysis demonstrated proteinuria with a quantitative count of around 1.2 gm/L with microscopic hematuria. A liver function test also showed mild transaminitis. Her microbiological study and culture were negative. An echocardiogram showed severe pulmonary hypertension, possibly from severe acute lung injury. It was reported that on an unspecified date she developed multiple organ failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (possibly from pulmonary hemorrhage), shock, acute renal failure with possible glomerulonephritis and thrombocytopenia. Systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or systemic vasculitis, were considered in the differential diagnosis, but all vasculitic screens including anti-nuclear antibody, Complement component 3 (C3) and Complement component 4 (C4) levels, 50 percent hemolytic complement (CH50), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA were negative. The patient's clinical condition slowly improved over the following 7 days with aggressive organ support, but no specific management. The author stated that the diagnosis of the patient was unclear; however vasculitis or an autoimmune disease was unlikely and a severe adverse event following H1N1 vaccination could not be completely excluded. Author concluded the article stating that physicians should remain alert to possible severe adverse reactions to monovalent H1N1 vaccine."
458663-1,"Information has been received from a published article on Infection, Genetics and Evolution. Abstract Rotavirus (RV) vaccination programs had been established in several countries using ROTARIX (GlaxoSmithKline) and/or ROTATEQ.  The efficacy of both vaccines was high (approximately 90%) in developed countries, but could be remarkably lower in developing countries. For example, a vaccine efficacy against severe diarrhea of only 58% was observed in a 2007-2009 the country study using ROTATEQ. To gain insight into the significant level of vaccine failure in this country,  we sequenced the genomes of RVs recovered from vaccinated children in the country with gastroenteritis. The results revealed that all had genotype specificities typical for human RVs (11 G1P[8], 1 G3P[8] and that the sequences and antigenic epitopes of the outer capsid proteins (VP4 and VP7) of these viruses were similar to those reported for RVs isolated elsewhere in the world. As expected, nine of the G1P[8] viruses and the single G3P[8] virus had genome constellations typical of human G1P[8] and G3P[8] RVs: G1/3-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1. However, two of the G1P[8] viruses had atypical constellations, G1-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N2-T1-E1-H1, due to the presence of a genotype-2 NSP2 (N2) gene. The sequence of the N2NSP2 gene was identical to the bovine N2NSP2 gene of ROTATEQ, indicating that the two atypical viruses originated via re-assortment of human G1P[8] RVs with ROTATEQ viruses. Together, our data suggest that the high level of vaccine failure in the country was probably not due to antigenic drift of commonly circulating virus strains nor the emergence of new antigenetically distinct virus strains. Furthermore, our data suggested that the widespread use of the ROTATEQ vaccine had led to the introduction of vaccine genes into circulating human RVs. Materials and methods Site description This study was carried out in a place located in Northern the country, which had an estimated population of 41,134 inhabitants of which 11% are children under 5 years of age. The city was located at 1074 m above sea level where the temperature ranges from 18 to 32 degrees C. The majority of the population was involved in agricultural activities related to the production of coffee. Secondary medical care for Gynecology-Obstetrics, General Surgery, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Neonatology, and Orthopedics was provided by Hospital. Study design From April to August in 2010, a hospital-based study of sporadic acute diarrhea was performed.  A total of 107 children of 65 years of age with acute diarrhea were enrolled in a longitudinal, prospective manner from either the emergency or pediatric room. After informed consent was acquired, epidemiological information was obtained for each case from the parents or guardians of the sick child. The Ethical Committee for Biometrics Research (Registration No. 61) of the Faculty of Medical Sciences approved this study. ROTATEQ immunization assessment In October of 2006, the Program initiated a universal RV vaccination program with ROTATEQ. ROTATEQ was orally administered in a 3-dose regiment to children at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The dates each child received vaccine doses were registered by an EPI nurse on the child's vaccination card. The ROTATEQ immunization data used in this study were collected from the children's vaccination cards. A child was considered ""unvaccinated"" if their vaccination card showed no recorded doses. ROTATEQ immunization status was considered ""unknown"" if the child's vaccination card was not available. Clinical assessment The clinical information for symptoms such as fever (>=38 degrees C), nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal cramps, abdominal distension (gas), and number of loose stools in the previous 24 h, dehydration status, and treatment plans were obtained by reviewing the information registered in clinical paper files. As proposed in the strategy for diarrhea management by the agency, all c"
460097-1,"This is spontaneous initial report received from the agency, regulatory authority report number TO20120851. A 12-month-old female patient received the suspected vaccines by intramuscular route, on 26Apr2012, one single dosage form, for vaccination (unspecified batch numbers): booster dose of PREVENAR 13 and PRIORIX. The patient developed erythema multiforme-like eruption, edema, petechiae and hematoma on 08May2012 which required hospitalization. In the night from 07 to 08May2012, 12 days after vaccination, the infant developed macular skin rash, erythema disappearing under vitropression, confluent, generalized periumbilical and perioral, spreading to lower limbs, buttocks, scalp, neck and arms. There were no associated signs (fever, diarrhea) but there was bilateral cyanic coloration on the knees that led to consultation in emergency unit. Probable post vaccination measle-like eruption was diagnosed in emergency unit, without seriousness but, no discharge, the symptoms aggravated with occurrence of hot edemas, petechiae and hematomas. Generalized erythema infectious due to parvovirus B19 was suspected, but viral serology result was negative. Treatment with PRIMARLAN was initiated and infant status improved. Laboratory work-up revealed normal results as well as negative results for viral serologies; platelet count was normal; urinary albumin and proteins were negative. Non-drug induced etiologies were ruled out no intake of toxic agent, no modification of food or washing powder; no notion of contagion, no travel abroad or recent infection. The reactions resolved without sequelae. Based on the Official Method of Causality Assessment, all suspected medicinal products were rated by the agency as doubtful. No FU attempts needed. No further information expected."
460219-1,"This misuse case was received from a physician via another company on 02-Jul-2012. Ref IE12-00864. This is one of two linked cases involving the same reporter and same vaccine and is linked with E2012-04505. This case is medically confirmed. A 14 month old female patient (one of a set of twins) received an injection of PNEUMOVAX II (batch number not reported), route and site not reported, on an unreported date. The patient was given PNEUMOVAX II instead of the scheduled PREVENAR 13. Therefore the patient received the wrong vaccine and was at an inappropriate age at vaccination. No information regarding any adverse effect was provided. Follow up received on 12-Jul-12 under the reference number 2012-012333. This case has been upgraded to serious. The patient had no significant concomitant illness or previous drug reaction. The PNEUMOVAX II vaccine was administered on 21-Jun-12, 0.5ml intramuscularly, injection site not reported. The patient also received a MMR vaccine (Manufacturer and batch number not reported) on the same day reported as concomitant. The patient was vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX II in error. As the patient was under two years of age she should have received a PREVENAR 13 vaccine. The patient has not suffered an adverse drug reaction and was due to receive the correct vaccine that evening. The health authorities have coded only the event of medication error and consider the events to be serious due to other medically important condition. Upon medical review the company judged relevant to code the following adverse events: LLT = ""No adverse effect""; ""Wrong vaccine administered""; ""Inappropriate age at vaccine administration"" which were mentioned in the narratives but not coded by HA."
460897-1,"Information received from a published article, concerning a group of 149 patients from an analysis study that were vaccinated with a dose of zoster vaccine live (manufacturer unknown) Context: Based on limited data, the live attenuated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine is contraindicated in patients taking anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies or other biologics commonly used to treat immune-mediated diseases. The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are unclear for these patients. Objective: To examine the association between HZ vaccination and HZ incidence within and beyond 42 days after vaccination in patients with selected immune-mediated diseased and in relation to biologics and other therapies used to treat these conditions. Herpes Zoster (HZ) Incidence Rate Within 42 days: A total of 7780 vaccinated patients contributed person-time within 42 days after vaccination; fewer than 11 HZ cases were observed, resulting in an overall incidence rate of 7.8 cases per 1000 person-years (95% C1, 3.716.5). HZ Incidence Rate after 42 days: During the period of more than 42 days after vaccination, the authors observed 138 HZ cases during 20639 person-years (6.7 cases per 1000 person-years; 95% C1, 5.7.9), resulting in a ration of 0.58 when compared with the incidence rate during unvaccinated person time (11.6 cases per 1000 person-years; 95% C1, 11.4-11.9; P< .001). A limitation relevant to the safety results was not that for HZ cases shortly after vaccination, the authors were unable to determine whether the HZ cases were caused by the vaccine virus strain or the wild-type virus strain, which is possible if biological samples from skin lesions were available for analysis. Another limitation was that the actual vaccine administration dates were unknown for 59% of the author's patients which resulted in the exclusion of these patients from safety (but the effectiveness) analyses. In conclusion, the author's data suggested that the live zoster vaccine may not be associated with increased risk of HZ shortly after vaccination in patients currently treated with biologics and that it was possibly associated with a significantly reduced longer-term HZ risk in patients with immune-mediated disease. The authors' data called into question the current recommendations that HZ vaccine was contraindicated in patients receiving biologics. No further information is available."
461542-1,"This case was reported by a healthcare professional and described the occurrence of sneezing in a female subject in her 40's who was vaccinated with FLUARIX (GlaxoSmithKline). On 11 October 2011 at 13:30 the subject received a dose of FLUARIX. On 12 October 2011, 1 day after vaccination with FLUARIX, the subject experienced sneezing. On 22 October 2011, 11 days after vaccination with FLUARIX, the subject developed chills, a sore throat, body pain, cough, nausea, vomiting, headache and eye pain. At the time of reporting, sneezing and body pain were improved and chills and sore throat were resolved. According to the reporter, all four of these events were probably related to vaccination with FLUARIX. The outcome and FLUARIX attribution of cough, nausea, vomiting, headache and eye pain were not known, although a note was made that these symptoms lasted several days. It was indicated that a coworker who did not receive the FLUARIX vaccination, but had been exposed to the subject had not gotten sick; therefore, the reporter believes the subject's symptoms were not a contagious illness, but rather a reaction to the vaccine. Two additional subjects experienced events following vaccination with FLUARIX. Linked cases are A0951445A and A0951452A. Follow-up information was received from the healthcare professional on 6 December 2011. Immediately after the subject received FLUARIX on 11 October 2011, she experienced mild runny nose and sneezing. No others who came in contact with the subject became ill. The events ""caused loss of work"". On unspecified date(s), all events resolved."
463169-1,"This case was reported by a physician and described the occurrence of lower limb edema in a 13-year-old female subject of who was vaccinated with CERVARIX (GlaxoSmithKline). On 23 July 2012, the subject received an unspecified dose of CERVARIX (.5 ml, intramuscular, administration site unknown, lot number not provided). On 23 July 2012, 1 hour after vaccination with CERVARIX, the subject experienced rash extensively developed with edema. The subject also vomited once. The subject was treated in another hospital and began to lead a normal life again in 2 days. On 25 July 2012, the events were resolved. The physician considered the events were related to vaccination with CERVARIX. Follow-up information received on 17 August 2012: This case was upgraded to serious. The subject's medical history included allergic rhinitis. No past history of atopy, asthma and urticaria. She didn't experience any adverse reactions to foods or drugs. Her mother had atopy and allergies to pyrine medicines. Her younger brother had been diagnosed with asthma. The batch number was provided. After vaccination, the subject was observed for 30 minutes and as no particular symptoms were noted. She returned home. Neither fever nor other symptoms were noted before the vaccination and she was in good condition. One hour and half after vaccination with CERVARIX, the subject experienced hot feeling. 30 minutes later, chills developed with generalized urticaria (especially on face and four limbs) which was accompanied by wheals. The sites of the wheals were whitish and redness was seen around the sites. The physician considered the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention). A chest x-ray and a blood test were performed. The subject was treated with ALLEGRA and SAXIZON. The condition of the symptoms hardly changed and neither improvement nor worsening of the symptoms was noted while she was in another hospital. She had no dyspnea or depressed level of consciousness. She vomited once in a car while returning home. Before going to bed, she had severe lower limb edema. On 24 July 2012, lower limb edema and wheals were resolved in the morning and body temperature was 37.1 deg.C. She stayed in bed all day. On 25 July 2012, fever and generalized urticaria were resolved. The symptoms had almost disappeared and she returned to a normal life. No relapse of the symptoms was particularly noted thereafter."
464537-1,"Information has been received from a literature article. The following neurological complications of varicella vaccine have been reported. Case 3: A healthy patient (gender unspecified) who was vaccinated with varicella virus vaccine live (manufacturer unknown) (dose not reported) at 16 months of age. At 4 years, a zoster rash developed on the right arm, followed by meningitis (important medical event, upon internal review). The article does not state where the patient was vaccinated. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) DNA was sent to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), GA for strain typing, and the presence of Oka Varicella-zoster-virus (VZV) was confirmed. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of zoster lesions also identified VZV, but genotyping was not performed. Of note, in several cases, the zoster event occurred in the same extremity as had received the varicella vaccination or was the likely site of vaccination. Since 4 million children are immunized yearly in the country, the neurovirulence of the live attenuated vaccine is dramatically less than that of the wild-type infection. Only a few cases of zoster and meningitis secondary to vaccine virus have been reported since 1995. Nevertheless, these cases illustrate that vaccine virus can occasionally establish latency in the dorsal root ganglia, especially those providing sensory fibers to the arm. Of note, at least 4 children with wild-type Central Nervous System (CNS) disease had had one varicella vaccination. The authors now know that one dose is insufficient to assure immunity throughout childhood. Therefore, these children undoubtedly had breakthrough varicella. Two doses of varicella vaccine during early childhood are now recommended to avoid the problem of breakthrough infection with wild-type varicella. In summary, the aforementioned data from the most populous state in the country demonstrate a dramatic reduction in the CNS complications of wild-type varicella in children. Implementation of the 2-dose varicella vaccination policy should eliminate the few cases of breakthrough disease. The detection of only one case of vaccine virus-related zoster demonstrates a diminished neurovirulence of the live attenuated vaccine. Additional information has been requested. This is one of several cases from the same source."

The following information is verbatim from the abstract: ""Meningococci have historically caused extensive illness among members. Three successive meningococcal vaccine types were used from 1971 through 2010; overall disease incidence dropped by >90% during this period. During 2006-2010, disease incidence of 0.38 (cases per 100,000 person-years) among members was not significantly different from the incidence of 0.26 among the age-matched general population. Of the 26 cases, 5 were fatal, 15 were vaccine failures (e.g., illness in a person who had been vaccinated), and 9 were caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y. Incidences among 17- to 19-year-old were significantly higher than among comparison populations (p<0.05). No apparent change in epidemiology of meningococcal disease was observed after replacement of quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccine with conjugate vaccine in 2007.

By that evening I was experiencing redness, soreness around the injection sight, headache, nausea but did not have a fever. By the next day there was a 4 inch circular raised rash at the sight and a very swollen and extremely tender lump 1 1/2 inch around anterior to the injection site. I still had the headache, nausea, and some diarrhea. I went back to the shot clinic and a doctor looked at it quickly but said the shot may have hit a lymph node and not to worry. After about the 3rd day the lump and tenderness as well as the headache had subsided. The rash, however, remained for a few more days. I had noticed some roughness on my upper back but couldn't see much. On October 29 after showering I noticed probably 20 purple oval/irregular spots on each of my lower legs. I am IN REMISSION for Wegener's Granulomatosis -6 months oral CYTOXAN and prednisone ending in Feb 2010- and knew the disease could show up on skin or in my lungs. Oct 30 In went to a local Emergi-Care and the doctor drew some bloodwork/urine sample and looked online and felt the purple spots looked like vasculitis photo and showed to me.

The labs came back negative over the following 12 day the rash spread to my stomach, upper and lower back, thighs and arms, and chest. During that time my immunologist was monitoring my rash via photos I had emailed. He recommended skin biopsies using immunofluorescence staining. I went to a dermatologist for the biopsies. He took three and they all came back Lichenoid Dermatitis. My immunologist felt that this indicated the rash was from a drug interaction or from the vaccine. Since there had been no changes to my medications that left the pneumococcal vaccine as the likely cause.

The currently 71-year-old patient stated that she a ""flu shot"", unknown manufacturer, in December 2012. Less than a month after vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine, in December 2012, she experienced cold symptoms which started with chills, followed by cough and fever. According to the patient, she subsequently saw her family physician and was started on BIAXIN for 10 days which made it necessary to place the TYKERB on hold, restarting it at the beginning of January 2013. The patient also took an antibiotic spray and rinse for sinus infection which was completed at the time of the report. The patient noted that since June or July 2012, about 22 or 23 months after starting TYKERB, she had noticed that her hair began thinning. Additionally, the on 02 January 2013, the patient stated that she saw her oncologist and that she has new lymph node growth on her left side and the physician was questioning TYKERB's continued effectiveness. The patient planned to have additional testing on 23 January 2013. The outcome of the previously reported events was not provided. The outcome of the cold symptoms, chills, cough, fever and sinus infection were resolved. The outcome for thin hair was unknown. The outcome for lymph node enlargement was unresolved. Follow up information received from the patient, via the TYKERB Patient Support Program, on 09 January 2013. The patient reported that her ""lymph nodes under her arm/on side have shrunk"". At the time of the follow up report, the events of lymph node enlargement and the lack of efficacy were considered improved."

On 22 November 2012, the subject received a first dose of PRIORIX (single dose, subcutaneous, unknown batch number) and a fourth dose of INFANRIXQUINTA (intramuscular, single dose, unknown batch number). On 24 November 2012 in the evening, two days after vaccination with INFANRIXQUINTA and PRIORIX, the subject experienced lower limb purpura on calves, with no other associated signs. On 28 November 2012, four days later, purpura extended to thighs and posterior. On 29 November 2012, the subject was seen in consultation. Platelet count and C-reactive protein were normal. Lymphopenia was found at 2.99 G/L. The subject was hospitalised. On 30 November 2012, urine culture and urine cytology were normal. Urine dipstick showed traces of protein. On 01 December 2012, protein urine at 24 hours was 0.16 grams. There was no arthralgia, no edema of the lower limbs, no urinary function signs. Thus, the hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis was not retained. An iatrogenic origin was considered in the genesis of the cutaneous purpura. On 03 December 2012, purpura had spontaneously disappeared with no sequelae. At the time of reporting, the events were resolved without sequelae. According to the agency, based on the method of assessment, the events were unlikely related to vaccination with PRIORIX and/or INFANRIXQUINTA."

The subject had no significant medication nor family medical history. On an unspecified date, the subject received an unspecified dose of Influenza vaccine (intramuscular, left deltoid). Within days of vaccination with Influenza vaccine, the subject experienced severe left shoulder pain. Within a week of the onset of shoulder pain, the subject experienced left upper arm weakness with difficulty performing her usual activities. On examination, there was left arm weakness of power of 1/5 on the Medical Research Council grading scale and painfully reduced range of movement of the left shoulder in all directions. The author considered the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention). An ultrasound scan of subject's shoulder did not reveal any of the more common differential diagnoses of shoulder joint arthritis, adhesive capsulitis, calcific tendinitis, rotator cuff muscle or tendon tears or tendinopathy. A cervical spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging was also normal, excluding cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy. Finally, upper limb nerve conduction studies and electromyography revealed severe axonal denervation of the left deltoid and supraspinatus muscles with mild involvement of the infraspinatus muscle and evidence of renervation. The subject was diagnosed with post vaccinal acute brachial neuritis and was treated with 40 mg of Prednisolon once daily for a week, followed by a reducing course. She was additionally prescribed amitriptyline and underwent physiotherapy. 4 months after the subject's initial presentation at emergency room, the pain had improved but there was mild residual global weakness of left shoulder movement. 8 months later, the events were resolved with sequelae (mild weakness of left arm)."

484457-1,"This case was reported by a physician and described the occurrence of intussusception in a 4-month-old male subject who was vaccinated with ROTARIX (GlaxoSmithKline). Concurrent vaccination included 1st dose of ROTARIX (GlaxoSmithKline, oral) given on 31 October 2012. On 12 December 2012, the subject received 2nd dose of ROTARIX (1.5 ml, oral). On 5 January 2013, 24 days after 2nd dose of vaccination with ROTARIX, the subject experienced bloody stools. Intussusception was diagnosed. The subject was hospitalised for 3 days (from 5 January 2013 to 7 January 2013). On 5 January 2013, reduction of the intussusception was performed by urgent laparotomy at the pediatric surgery department. On 7 January 2013, the intussusception was resolved and the subject was discharged. The outcome of the bloody stools was unspecified. The physician considered the intussusception was related to vaccination with ROTARIX. Follow-up information received on 29 January 2013: Barium enema was performed. On the same day, reduction was achieved by emergency laparotomy at the pediatric surgery department. Follow-up information received on 4 February 2013: The subject had no family history of intussusception or bowel abnormalities. The subject had no history of previous intra-abdominal surgery, no congenital intestinal malformation, no intestinal polyps, no Meckel's diverticulum, no intestinal vascular malformations, no cystic fibrosis, no Hirschsprung disease, no other gastrointestinal malformation and dysfunction, nor intussusception. From 18 December 2012 to 20 December 2012, the subject's father had gastroenteritis. On 26 December 2012, at 3:00, 14 days after vaccination with ROTARIX, the subject had bad mood. At 10:00, the subject vomited and experienced bloody stool. At 21:00, the subject visited the reporter's hospital off-hours. An intestinal remedy (LAC-B) was prescribed for suspected gastroenteritis and the subject went back home. On 27 December 2012, the subject continued to vomit twice or three times daily. On 5 January 2013, around 15:00, 24 days after vaccination with ROTARIX, the subject was diagnosed with intussusception on abdominal ultrasound. There was a multilayered structure near the hepatic flexure on the right side of the abdomen. It looked like a target sign in the short-axis section. The short diameter was about 32 mm. Color doppler showed scattered dotted-line blood flow signals. Otherwise, no obvious lymph node or ascites was noted within the range of the inspection. There was an impression of suspected intussusceptum. At 18:00, disinvagination was attempted with irrigoscopy and high pressure enema but could not be achieved. Subsequently, the subject was referred to the department of pediatric surgery so as to undergo open surgery for intussusception. The surgery was performed on the same day. There was no complications of surgery. On 8 January 2013, the subject was discharged from the hospital. Plain Abdominal Radiograph/Air or Liquid Contrast Enema was not confirmed. Visible intussusceptum or soft tissue mass, fluid levels and dilated bowel loops were not confirmed on plain abdominal radiograph. Demonstration of invagination of the intestine and an intra-abdominal mass was confirmed by air or liquid contrast enema and by abdominal ultrasound. Abdominal Computerized Tomography scan was not performed. On 5 January 2013, intussusception was confirmed during surgery. No intestinal resection was performed. Reporter mentioned that although the actual diagnosis of the disease was made and the disease was treated on 5 January 2013, the event could have developed on 26 December 2012 because vomiting and bloody stool developed on the day. If so, the event could have developed 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccination of ROTARIX (oral) on 12 December 2012. Although the duration between the 2nd vaccination and the event onset was 2 weeks, which was slightly longer than those in the previous reports of the event onset, this case was reported because"

This case is linked with the reference case 2013-03410. Abstract: ""BACKGROUND Serious, but rare events following immunization (AEFI) have been reported with yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine, including severe allergic reactions, YF vaccine-associated neurologic disease (YEL-AND) and YF vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). The frequency with which YEL-AND and YEL-AVD occur in YF endemic countries is mostly unknown. METHOD: From 2007 to 2010, eight countries implemented large-scale YF preventative vaccination campaigns. Each country established vaccine pharmacovigilance system that included standard case definitions, procedures to collect and transport biological specimens, and National Expert Committees to review data and classify cases. Staff in all countries received training and laboratory capacity expanded. RESULTS: In total, just over 38 million people were vaccinated against YF and 3116 AEFIs were reported of which 164 (5%) were classified as serious. Of these, 22 (13%) were classified as YF vaccine reactions, including 11 (50%) hypersensitivity reactions, six (27%) suspected YEL-AND, and five (23%) suspected YEL-AVD. The incidence per 100,000 vaccine doses administered was 8.2 for all reported AEFIs, 0.43 for any serious AEFI, 0.058 for YF vaccine related AEFIs, 0.029 for hypersensitivity reactions, 0.029 for hypersensitivity reactions, 0.016 for YELAND, and 0.013 for YEL-AVD. Our findings were limited by operational challenges, including difficulties in obtaining recommended biological specimens leading to incomplete laboratory evaluation, unknown case ascertainment, and variable levels of staff training and experience. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations, active case-finding in the eight different countries did not find an incidence of YF vaccine associated AEFIs that was higher than previous reports. These data reinforce the safety profile of YF vaccine and support the continued use of attenuated YF vaccine during preventative mass vaccination campaigns in YF endemic areas."" Study design and setting: ""From 2007 to 2010, active surveillance of serious AEFIs was undertaken during preventative YF vaccination campaigns . All countries were included in the analysis except one due to unavailability of the national database. Both the 17D-204 and 17DD YF substrain vaccines were 73 used.""

496794-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of acute meningoencephalitis in a 28-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with DTPa (with small D + P) (manufacturer unspecified) and Seasonal trivalent Influenza vaccine. On an unspecified date, the subject received an unspecified dose of DTPa (with small D + P) (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided) and an unspecified dose of Seasonal trivalent Influenza vaccine (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided). 5 days after vaccination with DTPa (with small D + P), 10 days after vaccination with Seasonal trivalent Influenza vaccine, the subject experienced nausea, vomiting and headache. The subject was hospitalised with photophobia, progressive weakness, acute change in mental status, confusion, expressive aphasia, neck pain and stiffness. The final diagnosis was acute meningoencephalitis with encephalopathy. At the time of reporting, the events were resolved. This is one of the 11 cases created from the same literature article. Summary of the literature article: Pre-licensure clinical trials for two licensed tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines did not reveal any major safety concerns. However, routine use in large adolescent and adult populations could reveal rare and potentially serious adverse events (AEs). To characterize reported AEs following Tdap vaccination and identify potential safety concerns warranting further evaluation, we analyzed data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and assessed the frequency and proportions of AEs and reporting rates (reports per 100,000 vaccine doses distributed). A total of 2090 reports (7% were serious; 55% listed Tdap alone) involving Tdap vaccines were submitted to VAERS May 2005 - June 2007. The crude reporting rate was 10.2 per 100,000 vaccine doses distributed. The median age of vaccinees was 22 years, and the female to male ratio was about 2 to 1. The majority of reports described common local and systemic signs and symptoms, such as injection site reactions, fever, and headache. Rarely reported AEs included myopericarditis, demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, syncope, encephalopathy/encephalitis, seizure, Bell's palsy, anaphylaxis, and thrombocytopenia. The author's conclusion stated that because adolescents and adults were not routinely vaccinated against pertussis in the past, this surveillance summary provides important - and reassuring - information about the use of Tdap in these age groups. Although subject to the limitations of passive surveillance, the findings of this VAERS review support the pre-licensure clinical trial data with regard to the safety of the licensed Tdap vaccines. Continued monitoring of clinically significant AEs that are temporally associated with Tdap vaccination and further assessment of such events using controlled observational studies may provide additional information about the safety of these vaccines."
498088-1,"This case was received from a health care professional on 22-Mar-13. This case is medically confirmed. A 32 year old female patient with an unreported medical history and unreported concomitant medication, received a second dose of a VARIVAX (batch number not reported) route and site not reported on 21-Feb-13. On an unreported date, one week post vaccination, the patient experienced an extremely bad rash with hives and lesions that burst on her chest, back and arms. The patient received the first dose of VARIVAX (batch number H014406) route and site not reported on 17-Jan-13. The patient insists that she had the rash prior to commencing treatment with AUGMENTIN one week post vaccination for an unreported indication. The patient received corrective treatment with unspecified antihistamines. At the time of reporting, the rash is improving a little and the patient is recovering. The reporter confirmed that the rash was hives like and not varicella like. Follow up received from the IMB on 04-Apr-2013. IMB REF 2013-016700. This case has been upgraded to serious by the IMB. The patient had no relevant medical history and had no previous reactions to vaccinations or medications. The patient was not taking any concomitant medication. The patient received dose two of VARIVAX (batch number H014406, added on 26-Apr-2013), 0.5mls, intramuscularly. Seven days post vaccination the patient developed an itchy rash on her chest, back and arms. The reporter stated that the subject medication was unknown due to the adverse reaction. At the time of reporting the patient's symptoms were easing and the reaction was resolving. The events were considered to be medically significant. Follow up received from the HCP reporter on 26/Apr/2013: The patient still had the rash on her arms and had been referred to a dermatologist. The rash on her chest and back had cleared up. Batch number for dose 2, reported int he corresponding field in the previous version was added in the single case comments. Follow up received from a HCP on 22-Jul-2013: It was reported that the patient received the second dose of VARIVAX in left deltoid. The patient described think pruritic patches which occurred at the inoculation site with some associated vesicles on the distal left forearms. The rash subsequently spread to involve the neck, back, chest and abdomen with minimal lower limb involvement. There was no systemic features. The patient denied any previous history of atopy or psoriasis. A clinical examination of the upper body only was performed (at the patient's request). Bilateral symmetric violaceous patches are noted on the posterior axillary regions with small round patchy areas of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation noted on the anterior axillary and deltoid regions. Similar post inflammatory hyperpigmented changes were also noted over the entire back. The dermatologist thought the patient did develop an exanthematous reaction to varicella vaccine. This has largely resolved apart from the active patches on the posterior axillary areas next week. The rest of her current rash was actually post inflammatory hyperpigmentation which is very commonly seen in skin phototype 4 (and above) after an inflammatory rash. Dermatologist explained to the patient that it will be many months before such post inflammatory hyperpigmentation resolves and the hyperpigmentation may not completely disappear. Dermatologist advised to avoid any significant ultraviolet radiation exposure on this hyperpigmentation as it can darken it further. The patient received corrective treatment with ELOCON ointment once a day for 2 weeks and AVEENO Dermexa cream as once daily emollient. At the time of reporting, the patient had some residual hyperpigmentation in the axillary area. The lichenoid reactions seemed to have resolved with the steroid treatment."

The patient experienced hyperthemia on 07Jun2013 (previously reported as on 08Jun2013, the patient developed pyrexia of 38 degrees Centigrade again and hospitalization was decided as a precautionary measure); at the time of the hospital admission, on 08Jun2013, the patient was already recovered from the pyrexia). The clinical course of events was as follows: from the evening of the same date after vaccination on 07Jun2013, the patient's body temperature was 38 degrees Centigrade. The patient had continuous hyperthermia with body temperature of over 38 degrees C and presented to reporter's clinic on 08Jun2013.

The patient received intravenous drip of SOLITA T NO.3 at 200mL and ROCEPHIN at 250 g on the day. Due to the significant increase of white blood cell count, the patient was referred to another hospital for hospitalization. The patient was discharged on 13Jun2013 (5th hospital stay). The reporting pediatrician classified the events as non-serious and assessed pyrexia as probably related to PREVENAR, CRP increased as possibly related and assessed hyperthermia and white blood cell count increased as definitely related to the PREVENAR. The reporting pediatrician commented that although a transient fever due to PREVENAR is highly suspected based on the temporal association, the possibility of infection could not be ruled out either.

Her current and family histories were remarkable for Raynaud's phenomenon while her maternal aunt was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis. On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with the first dose of GARDASIL (lot number, expiry date, dose and route unspecified). No concomitant therapy was reported. On an unknown date, the patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department because of high-grade fever (39.5 degree Celsius (C)), generalized asthenia, diffuse polyarthralgia, and, multiple erythematous annular cutaneous lesions on the face, trunk, and lower limbs which occurred 8 days after the first dose of GARDASIL. While she received the vaccine, she developed low-grade fever, which was interpreted as viral flu syndrome. Laboratory examinations revealed normochromic normocytic anemia with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), an extensive bacterial and viral screening was negative and her urine sediment was normal. Autoantibodies profile revealed seropositivity for antinuclear antibody (ANA) and lupus anticoagulant (LAC). On an unknown date, a diagnosis of lupus-like syndrome was determined and the patient was treated with intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone (PDN). Following initiation of treatment, her blood temperature normalized and her skin lesions significantly improved with almost complete resolution in a month, while receiving 50 milligrams (mg) of PDN. The latter was tapered down within 6 months, and at 1 year following vaccination the patient was in good health. The reporter considered the event to be related to GARDASIL. It was reported that the highest relative risk for an individual autoimmune event was for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A causal link between HPV vaccination and onset or relapse of SLE is plausible. This is one of the several reports from the same source. Additional information has been requested."
502367-1,"Information has been received from a physician, the author of the literature report, concerning a 105 days infant, gender unknown. The infant was a preterm baby and had low birth weight of 1001-1500 g. This was a prospective observational cohort study in all VLBW infants who were discharged from the NICU from May 1, 2008 to April 22, 2010 when rotavirus vaccination (manufacturer unknown) with RV5 was provided at discharge to all age-eligible infants. The medical records of the infants were reviewed, and pertinent demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded. The number of infants who received the rotavirus vaccine, the number of missed opportunities for vaccination, and the number of infants falling outside the recommended time period for vaccination were recorded and analyzed. There were no complications noted on follow-up. On an unknown date the infant was vaccinated despite being older than the recommended age limit at the time of discharge. Rotavirus vaccination (manufacturer unknown) is recommended for use in preterm infants at the time of discharge from the NICU as long as they are clinically stable and have an age range of 42 to 104 days V.10. Our study highlights the limitations of the currently recommended schedule for rotavirus vaccination, because 22% of all VLBW infants were too old at discharge to receive the vaccine. In addition 52% of all ELBW infants discharged from the NICU were older than 104 days and also were not vaccinated. This is one of four reports received from the same source. A copy of the published article is attached as further documentation of the patient's experience. Additional information has been requested."

On 24 May 2013, immediately after vaccination with TWINRIX adult, the subject experienced injection site irritation and hematoma and less than one day after vaccination with TWINRIX adult, the subject experienced fever, ache in the body and swelling of lymph nodes with a burning feeling which was severe but did not affect the respiratory system. On an unspecified date, less than a week after vaccination with TWINRIX adult, the subject experienced tiredness, nausea, headache and had a feeling of poison symptoms. A large nodule formed at the injection site that resolved after a while but flared at the same time as injection site irritation and hematoma flared. It itched and became red to such an extent that the subject was treated with unspecified antihistamines. Flaring up was suspected to be in connection to stress or lowered immune defence. On 28 May 2013, fever, body pain and swollen lymph node with burning sensation were resolved. At the time of reporting, nodule injection site, hematoma injection site, injection site irritation, redness and pruritus were unresolved and the outcomes of tiredness, nausea, and headache were unspecified. Follow- up received on 23 September 2013: Concurrent medical conditions included allergies to molds, penicillin, pollen and mites and irritable bowel syndrome.

505808-1,"Information had been received from a female who reported that her sister was injected with PNEUMOVAX23 by her physician on 10-JAN-2013 during a physical exam. It was immediately after her well physical that the patient had begun her ""own respiratory nightmare"". The patient began wheezing and having trouble breathing the very weekend following her pneumonia vaccination. She had several emergency room visits and was then hospitalized for over a week. Following discharge, the patient was sent to rehabilitation for another week. When the patient finally got back to her independent apartment, she continued to have the same breathing and wheezing issues. Thinking it was possibly being exacerbated by secondhand smoke, the patient's sister moved her to a nursing rehabilitation center. At the time the patient first became ill, she never even thought of the vaccination. Patient was taken off of the vitamin D that her physician had ordered thinking she may be allergic to it. The patient's sister noted that they never thought it could have been related to the pneumonia vaccine. At this time, the patient battles her breathing issues every day. The reporter who also had events with PNEUMOVAX23 (see MARRS# 1309USA014552 stated she woke up with a real feeling of constriction in the lower part of her lungs. She realized that she was no longer normally breathing from the diaphragm, but only from her upper chest. It was a very shallow and difficult breathing pattern. When she tried to take deep breaths to the diaphragm, she could make the air go there, but it hurt. This was the exact breathing pattern that her sister had begun to use. Deep breathing was hard for her sister. Her sister simply had not recovered with all the best medical attention she had been able to access. It was reported that the patient had lost her freedom and all her wordly possessions at 61 years of age. This time last year that patient was doing well and had no breathing issues. Now she was on multiple nebulizer treatments a day and nothing stops the wheeze. The patient was now confined to a wheelchair. On 30-AUG-2013, patient saw her physician who had been working with her since the hospitalization. Physician scheduled a scope of the patient's bronchial tubes in an effort to find out what was wrong. The patient began to use a breathing pattern that included taking deep breaths to the diaphragm because deep breathing was hard for her. The patient's sister reported that she knew PNEUMOVAX23 caused her illness and knew that her sister had the exact same thing happen to her. The patient's sister also noted she was doubtful the patient would ever be okay again as she was already handicapped from a car wreck at the age of 18. Wheezing, trouble breathing, and shallow breathing were considered to be disabling. This is one of several reports from the same source. Additional information has been requested."

In July 2013, 5 days after vaccination with ROTARIX, the subject experienced gastroenteritis and diarrhea and visited the reporter's hospital. On an unspecified date, in July 2013, the subject underwent a simple stool test and viral test, both of which revealed rotavirus positive result. On 10 July 2013, the subject was hospitalised and received treatment for severe symptoms including dehydration. On 09 August 2013, as the symptoms subsided and the body weight increased, the subject was discharged from the hospital. On 30 August 2013, the events were resolved. The physician considered the diarrhea was related to vaccination with ROTARIX as at the time of onset of event, no epidemic of rotavirus gastroenteritis had occurred. Follow up information was received on 14 November 2013: The subject's medical history included diarrhea. On 04 July 2013, the subject received unspecified dose of ROTARIX. On 08 July 2013, the subject had vomiting once. On 09 July 2013, from night onwards, the subject began to have vomiting at each sucking occasion. On 10 July 2013, the subject was hospitalized and then referred to the department of pediatrics in hospital B for suspected hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Chest sound was clear, and heart sounds were regular with no murmur. The abdomen was soft with no mass. Mild distension was noted. The anterior fontanelle was flat. The subject was followed by observation with receiving fluid infusion, antiflatuent, and breast feeding continuously. The subject was able to suckle and the frequency of vomiting appeared to decrease, but diarrhoea occurred frequently at 10 times or more per day. After that, the subject experienced no vomiting and was able to suckle.On 8th day of hospitalization, the subject weight increased from 4842 g to 4870 g. On 9th day of hospitalization, since the weight increased to 4928 g, the rate of drip infusion was slowed. On 10th day of hospitalization, after the needle was removed, diarrhoea of 10 times or more per day persisted. On 11th day of hospitalization, the weight became 4866 g. On 12th day of hospitalization, as the weight decreased to 4630 g, the drip infusion was resumed. As per laboratory results, diarrhea was considered to be osmotic and the subject was highly likely to have secondary lactose intolerance (cow's milk intolerance). The subject was followed by observation with receiving MILLACT, oral antiflatuent, and fluid infusion. On an unspecified date, breast-feeding was discontinued and lactose-free milk was given to subject. However, diarrhoea tended to improve gradually and the weight increased favorably. Thus the drip infusion was tapered and then discontinued. On 09 August 2013, the subject was discharged from the hospital and his weight was found to be 5736 g. As the subject had protracted diarrhoea 5 days after receiving ROTARIX, the physician considered the diarrhea was related to vaccination with ROTARIX. As echography showed no thickening of the pyloric muscle, and faecal rotavirus test showed a positive result, the subject's condition was considered to be attributable to the effect of rotavirus vaccine or rotavirus gastroenteritis."

516529-1,"Initial information has been received from a physician concerning a 15-year-old female patient. On 24-SEP-2011, the patient received a GARDASIL syringe injection drug intramuscularly (dose, injection site, and lot number not reported). No concomitant medication was reported. On 24-SEP-2011, the patient vaccinated with GARDASIL as stated above. On 27-SEP-2011, three days after the above vaccination, the patient experienced numbness in left hand.

She did not recovered from pain in extremities, numbness, pain, and muscle weakness of lower extremities, and difficulty in walking (the second time). The outcome of pain in MP joint of right all fingers, oedema in right hand, vomiting, and diarrhoea was unknown. Reporter's comment: The causal relationship of the events to GARDASIL is highly likely because the symptom appeared three days after the vaccination. The reporting physician considered that numbness in left hand (4, 5 fingers), pain in extremities, pain, difficulty in walking (the second time), and numbness, pain and muscle weakness of lower extremities were related to GARDASIL and did not assess the causality of pain in MP joint of right all fingers, oedema in right hand, vomiting, and diarrhoea to GARDASIL. The reporting physician considered difficulty in walking (the first time) as serious (disability), and numbness, pain, and muscle weakness of lower extremities, and difficulty in walking (the second time) as serious (hospitalization), and also considered numbness in left hand (4, 5 fingers), pain in extremities as non-serious. The reporting physician did not assess the seriousness of pain in MP joint of right all fingers, oedema in right hand, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Additional information has been requested."

The same day on 03-oct-2013, the patient experienced severe headache as his head was very painful and unbearable, had shingles in the back of eyes according to the hospital and had severe swollen eyes. Indeed, his eyes swelled very badly and one was still almost closed therefore the patient couldn't see at all from one eye. On an unreported date, the patient also felt poorly. The patient attended to hospital (no information about patient's hospitalisation was provided) who told him that the bad swelling and swabs taken from his eyes showed that he was full of shingles behind his eyes. At the time of reporting, the patient has not recovered from all the adverse events. The MHRA considered that case serious due to be medically significant."
517106-1,"This case was reported by a physician via a sales representative, and described the occurrence of intussusception in a 4-month-old female subject who was vaccinated with ROTARIX (GlaxoSmithKline). The subject has a twin sister who was vaccinated the same day. On 23 February 2007 the subject received unspecified dose of ROTARIX (oral, lot number not provided). On 1 March 2007, 6 days after vaccination with ROTARIX, the subject was sweating and her mother found blood in the stools. The paediatrician gave no importance to the event. During the afternoon, the subject presented again bloody stools and was hospitalised with the diagnosis of suspected intussusception. Different tests were performed and did not show intussusception, but this eventually was not discarded. The results of stool culture to find campylobacter and other tests are pending. At the time of this report, the subject was still hospitalized and presented still semi-liquid bloody stools (described as a thread of blood) but was in a good general condition and did not present colics. Follow-up information received on 5 March 2007 from the pharmacist and on 7 March 2007 from the sales representative: On 2 March 2007, a lab test showed a decreased count of platelets. The pharmacist thought that a blood transfusion was done, but is not sure. The baby was well and was being fed. The same day, the sales representative talked to the physician, different tests were performed to find the etiology. On 7 March 2007, he talked again to the physician. The stool culture was negative. The baby was still hospitalised but was stable, ate and defecated normally. He didn't know if blood was still present in stools. Different tests were performed to discard intussusception, the physician did not rule out that diagnosis but the baby had not presented cramps or pain. An echography was performed but the image was not clear and it was not possible to exclude intussusception. The subject's twin sister did not present any adverse event. The physician could not rule out ROTARIX as possible cause of the symptoms. Follow-up information received on 16 March 2007 from the pharmacist via the subject's aunt: The subject had completely recovered and was discharged from hospital on 09 March 2007, she eats a lot. Before leaving, a lumbar puncture was performed, with satisfactory results. It was confirmed that the subject received a transfusion during hospitalization because of the low level of platelet (1500), but it was not specified whether it was platelets or red cells. An echography finally discarded intussusception. The subject should go to periodic visits to the physician. The paediatrician cannot assure that the vaccine has not any relationship with the events. Follow-up information received on 21 March 2007 from the sales representative: The subject has been transferred from her paediatrician to a pediatric hematologist from the same hospital. During hospitalization the patient had a level of platelets of 12000. She received a platelets transfusion and the value increased to 90000. Six hours later it decreased again down to 30000. When she was discharged from hospital, the baby had a normal level of platelets after being treated with gammaglobulins. A peripheric serology is pending, all the medullary serologies performed showed negative results for viruses. A Doppler echography was also performed, the result was not provided. The subject must be closely followed by weekly reviews. Follow-up information received on 27 March 2007 from the sales representative: The medullar serologic test performed had a positive result for Epstein-Barr virus, which was negative at peripheric serology test in which it was probably hidden. The physician thought that Epstein-Barr virus could possibly be the cause of the decreased count of platelets, described in this follow-up report as thrombocytopenia. The radiologies done at admission were revised by a special radiologist, who confirmed an intussusception with s"
517252-1,"Case retrieved from literature on 12-Dec-2013. Information has been received from Sanofi Pasteur as part of business agreement (manufacturer control # FI-1577272925-E2013-10744) on 17-DEC-2013. It was reported in the journal article that a 7 years and 8 months old school girl which was not vaccinated with ROTATEQ was seen in the ED in February 2013 on the third day of symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. There was, no information in this literature article regarding the patient initially vaccinated with ROTATEQ which could be the origin of this suspicion of secondary transmission. Before admission, she had forceful vomiting (with 10 vomiting episodes/24h) for 2 days and mild diarrhea for 1 day (3 diarrheal stools before admission). In the ED, she had a rectal temperature of 37.8 degrees C, her feet cold and the mouth and tongue were dry. The estimated dehydration rate was 3%. As her general condition was not good and she refused to eat or drink overnight admission, the patient was rehydrated both intravenously and with an oral rehydration solution and discharged the next day when dehydration had been corrected, diarrhea had ceased, there was no more fever. Still, at home the vomiting continued for another 5 days. The child was the second of 4 children, had normal development and had no medications or diseases. She had been hospitalized once, at the age of 1 year for gastroenteritis that had affected all her family at the same time. She had not received rotavirus vaccine because of her age but was up-to-date on all other vaccinations. Two separate stool specimens were collected on the second day in hospital and both were found positive for rotavirus in both ELISA and RT-PCR. Genotyping and sequencing confirmed that the virus in both stool samples was a vaccine-derived G1P[8] human-bovine double reassortant rotavirus. A 930 bp fragment of the VP7 gene and a 570bp fragment of the gene segment encoding for VP4 were 100% identical to cognate gene segments from the corresponding original G1P[5] and G6P[8] viruses in ROTATEQ (accession number GU565057.1) (100% identity, 0% gaps). Further analysis of a 360bp fragment of VP6 nucleotide sequence was also 100% identical to the WC3 cognate gene of ROTATEQ. As the samples were ELISA positive, suggesting a high amount of virus (optical density of 0.710 when the limit of positivity in Rotaclone test is >0.15), one of them was propagated in MA104 cells. The virus was found to be highly infectious in the cell culture and was cultivated up to 3 passages, during which it remained stable and identical to the original isolate. Neither RT-PCR  nor sequencing detected any other rotavirus strains in the stool specimen. All tests for other gastroenteritis viruses (norovirus, sapovirus and adenovirus) were negative. After the study results became available, the child's parents were contacted to find out about any possible source of ROTATEQ vaccine-derived double assortant virus. The patient's unvaccinated 11-year-old and 5-year-old siblings had gastroenteritis symptoms before the onset of her symptoms, but as their clinical was milder they did not require any healthcare visits. Both the parents and a vaccinated 2-year-old sibling were asymptomatic. The family did not have known contact with any infant who might have recently received rotavirus vaccine. The child gave a follow-up stool specimen 14 weeks later for detection of possible prolonged shedding of the vaccine derived virus but this specimen was negative for rotavirus in RT-PCR. The case was considered as serious by the company, due to hospitalization. The outcome was recovered, as no virus shedding was found 14 weeks later."

Later, this event became severe and the patient was limping at the time of reporting (onset date of limping not reported). The reporter added that the patient had no other symptoms, no rash, redness or swelling. His doctor prescribed him anti-inflammatories and analgesics. At the time of reporting, the patient had not recovered from the adverse events. Follow up received from the initial reporter on 22-Nov-2013: The patient was still experiencing pain and a limp in the left lower limb which was treated with PALEXIA to no effect. The patient's condition was not resolving. Follow-up information received on 16-Dec-2013 from the initial reporter who is a physician. Patient's date of birth and weight (82 kg) were added. The patient had a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft and Barrett's oesophagus. It was reported the patient is not obese. The patient experienced dyspepsia with aspirin on 20-Nov-1988 and flushes with NIASPAN on 15-Oct-2004. The patient received a first dose of ZOSTAVAX 0.5 mL intramuscularly in the right arm. He also received a first dose of influenza vaccine (batch number K7237-3) 0.5 mL intramuscularly in the left arm. On 09-Nov-2013, the patient experienced severe neuropathic type pain in left lower limb and the reporter considered the relationship to vaccines as definite. The patient received corrective treatment with PALEXIA SR 300 mg daily. The patient received concomitant treatment with NEXIUM 20 mg orally daily since 05-Dec-2011 for Barrett's oesophagus, felodipine MR 10 mg orally daily since 08-Jan-2013 for hypertension, clopidogrel 75 mg orally daily since 20-May-2010, AMIAS 16 mg orally daily since 05-Jun-1999 for hypertension, tadalafil 5 mg orally daily since 20-May-2009 for erectile disorder and LIPOSTAT from 11-Oct-2011 for ischemic heart disease and all concomitant were still ongoing. The reporter considered that case serious due to the patient's disability. At the time of reporting, the patient did not recovered from neuropathic pain."
518130-1,"This case was reported by the foreign Regulatory Authority (reference GR20130995) and described the occurrence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome in an 11-year-old male subject who was vaccinated with INFANRIX TETRA (GlaxoSmithKline). In February 2002, April 2002 and May 2002, the subject received respectively 1st, 2nd and 3rd dose of PENTAVAC (non-gsk). In July 2005, after 3 years old, the subject received a dose of INFANRIX QUINTA (inappropriate age at vaccine administration). In September 2008, after 6 years old, the subject received a dose of INFANRIX TETRA (wrong vaccine administered, inappropriate age at vaccine administration). On 11 September 2013, the subject received a dose of INFANRIX TETRA (intramuscular, batch AC20B253AG, injection site unknown) (wrong vaccine administered). On 12 October 2013, i.e. 31 days after vaccination with INFANRIX TETRA, the subject consulted the emergency unit for pain and then weakness of lower limbs, loss of perineal sensitivity, and abolished patellar tendon reflexes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level was increased at 4.04 g/L (i.e. above the normal level) with no white elements in the CSF. The patient was hospitalized and was treated with immunoglobulins that same day. On 14 October 2013, immunoglobulins were given again to the subject. The treatment with immunoglobulins enabled the subject's condition to improve. On 18 October 2013, the subject was transferred to the pediatrics re-education unit. Electromyogram led to the conclusion that the subject had motor-sensory demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis, with a pronounced secondary axonal loss. On 23 October 2013, the subject's condition worsened and he was hospitalized again in the pediatrics intensive care unit. The subject had swallowing disorders, respiratory difficulties which required intubation, severe motor deficit of lower limbs (testing at 1 out of 5) and upper limbs (testing at 3 out of 5), pharyngeal discomfort when swallowing food, and frequent aspiration of liquids. Differential diagnosis included serology tests which showed positive results for Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Immunoglobulins G (IgGs), mumps IgGs, mycoplasma IgGs, Epstein Barr Virus IgGs, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgGs, and Lyme's IgGs. Campylobacter and syphilis serologies were negative. Anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) antibody level was positive. Serology for Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) showed presence of IgGs and IgMs, but Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for HSV in the CSF showed negative results. From 30 October to 04 November 2013, despite the negative PCR result for HSV, the subject was given treatment with ZOVIRAX. On 31 October 2013, 02 November 2013, 04 November 2013 and 06 November 2013, the subject underwent respectively for plasma exchanges. At the time of reporting, Guillain-Barre Syndrome was unresolved. The subject was currently recovering slowly but favorably. He was transferred to the re-education pediatrics unit for further care. According to the regulatory authority, based on the foreign method of assessment, the causal relationship between INFANRIX TETRA and Guillain-Barre Syndrome was considered unlikely."

519950-1,"This case was reported by a consumer (via a GSK employee) and later confirmed by a physician and described the occurrence of basal pneumonia in a 4-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with FLUARIX (GlaxoSmithKline). The subject had no relevant medical history and was in a healthy condition at the time of vaccination. There was no pathological background and no risk factors were associated. No concurrent medications were reported. On 4 January 2014, the subject received unspecified dose of FLUARIX (unknown route and injection site). On 7 January 2014, 3 days after vaccination with FLUARIX, the subject experienced general discomfort and fever that was difficult to control. On 10 January 2014, the subject was hospitalised for 4 days. X-ray was performed revealing a right basal pneumonia. In addition, a viral typification test was performed and influenza type A was detected. Therefore, influenza and pneumonia were diagnosed. The subject did not experience meningitis, epiglottitis, bacteraemia, septic arthritis, cellulitis, pneumonia and otitis media. The subject was treated with TAMIFLU, parenteral ceftriaxone and parenteral amikacin. On 11 January 2014, the subject satisfactorily improved.

The child was followed at the infantile neuropsychiatry for pervasive disorder of the development on an unspecified date. There was marked retardation of the cognitive skills, verbal and relational expected for age. There was no spontaneous structuring of game. The patient tended to be very explorative, hyperkinetic and dispersive. The mediation of the adult helped him to take action in a simple activities that always required guide also physical. The gaze was present, even if elusive and little used by the child for mediated social interaction. The language was mostly absent and the understanding was very limited. The approach was dispersive and chaotic, there was poor self-awareness. He recognized caregivers and turned to his father to ask for help to mediate the fulfillment of a wish. There was poor modulation mimic and was stereotyped and always characterized by the smile. In front of frustration emerged oppositional behavior, he was not always easily containable. Language production was almost absent. The understanding of simple verbal commands seemed not to be present. The attention was directed mainly to the object. It was difficult to extend the attention at times. It was reported that the child must be properly motivated, guided and supported with activities that he liked. For the daily autonomies, he was dependent on the shape of the adult, hardly exposed his needs so as to be satisfied. The opportunities were poor until now for interaction with coetaneous. At school, he needed individualized relation to support emerging skills, to promote social interaction and autonomy, to organize educational work aimed at improving the communication skills and the timing of attention.

521389-1,"Case retrieved from the literature on 20-JAN-2014. Information has been received from Sanofi Pasteur as part of a business agreement (manufacturer control # ES-1577272925-E2014-00553) on 28-JAN-2014. Case medically confirmed. This case is linked with the mother case E2014-00549 (same article, same suspect vaccine, same adverse event, different patient). Abstract: Regular screening methods may miss the diagnosis of occult hepatitis B infection and seronegative hepatitis C virus infection in immunocompromised patients. A cross-sectional study within a foreign cohort of HIV-infected children yielded 6 of 254 (2.4%) possible occult hepatitis B infection(OBI) cases and 2 of 254 (0.8%) seronegative hepatitis C virus-infected patients. Implementation of occult hepatitis screening in the routine care of these children may be warranted. Results: Of 838 HIV-infected pediatric patients, 254 were evaluated (30% patients from the total of the cohort, 18% of centers). No significant differences were observed when comparing our population with the general cohort. Median age was 14.4 years (interquartile range: 9.2-16.7), 55.6% of participants were female. In 95% of patients, the route of HIV acquisition was mother-to-child transmission. Maternal serostatus was positive in 3.9% for HBV and in 24.4% for HCV; however, data regarding HBV and HCV infection serostatus were missing for 44.8% and 40.6% of the mothers, respectively. Plasma HIV-VL was undetectable in two thirds, and median CD4+ T-cell count was 840/mm3 (interquartile range: 577-1117). Almost one third of patients met the criteria for AIDS. Among patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy, ever/current exposure to drugs with anti-HBV activity were 91% and 30% for lamivudine/emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, respectively. Almost 90% of patients had completed the HBV vaccination schedule, but only one half of them achieved protective anti-HBs levels. No association was found between responsiveness and CD4+ T-lymphocyte nadir counts < 20 cells/mm3, higher VL or age. Three (1.3%) patients were chronically infected with HBV at inclusion (HBsAg+, anti-HBc IgM+, anti-HBs-), HBV-DNA was negative but all of them received HIV/HBV-active drugs. No cases of acute HBV infection were detected. The diagnosis of confirmed occult hepatitis B infection was established on HBV-DNA detection in the serum of HBsAg-negative patients, with or without other serologic markers of previous viral exposure. Possible OBI is defines as positive testing to anti-HBc IgG alone (anti-HBc alone serostatus) or to both anti-HBc and anti-HBs but no HBV-DNA detected. HBV-DNA detection in liver samples was not performed in any case. Six possible OBI cases (2.4%; 95% confidence interval:0.8-5.1), but no confirmed case were detected: 2 patients showed an anti-HBc alone pattern (0.8%) whereas 4 cases were both anti-HBc and anti-HBs positive (1.6%). HBV-DNA was undetectable in all cases and only 1 anti-HBc/anti-HBs-positive patient showed mild elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase plasma levels (46 and 52 IU/mL, respectively). Five of these 6 patients were currently receiving at least 1 antiretroviral drug with activity against HBV, and did not show significantly lower CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts or higher plasma HIV-VL when compared with chronically HBV-infected patients. Fifteen (6%) patients were coinfected with HCV when evaluated by conventional serological screening methods. 1/w of them had spontaneously cleared HCV infection. All of them were HBV-DNA negative. Triple HCV-HBV-HIV coinfection was not observed in any patient. Seronegative HCV infection was detected in 2 patients (0.8%; 95% confidence interval: 0.1-2.8), both of whom showed elevated alanine aminotransferase plasma levels (51 and 77 IU/mL, respectively). There were no differences in HCV-RNA levels between anti-HCV positive and anti-HCV negative cases. This case concerns an 11 year-old female patient with HIV infect"
521398-1,"Case received from the patient insurance company (reference number 14-0126) via the Health Authorities on 22-Jan-2014 under the reference DK-DKMA-ADR 22386688. Case is not medically confirmed. Primary source was a lawyer. A 27-year-old female patient (weight and height not reported) with no medical history received the second dose of GARDASIL (batch number not reported) via not reported route into not reported site of administration on 16-Jan-2013. On 17-Jan-2013, 1 day after vaccination, she developed headache, joint pain in the hips and tenderness throughout the body. She had a lot of headaches. She had a very sore arm, the one that got stung. It lasted approximately 3 weeks. Pain in the left arm started around February 2013. Pain in right arm started approximately 2 weeks after. In February, she began to exercise less because of pain in her arms. In April, it went really bad, and she could not complete a training session. Then she went to see a physiotherapist. Her physical therapist was unsure if the pain came from the back, or whether it was a tennis elbow. She suggested a chiropractor when her treatment had no effect. After various examinations the chiropractor stated that it was tennis elbow in both arms. He advised her to go to the doctor and to keep her arms at rest. When the work performance started to cause her problems because of pain, she got lighter jobs in approx. 14 days, but because of the pain she had to take sick leave from 16-May-2013. She was at the general practitioner on 21-May-2013 who also believed it was tennis elbow / golf elbow in both arms since she was in pain where the doctor had pressed. They agreed that she should keep her arms at rest and do some specific exercises. During a control 14 days after there was no improvement in her arms, so she was referred to a rheumatologist. The blockades only made it worse. Despite the fact that she has not exercised for a long time and have not worked, the pain only got worse. Investigations were performed by private doctor, physiotherapist and chiropractor. The patient also received other alternative treatment. On 31-Oct-2013, there was a consultation at Hospital. On 04-Nov-2013 an ultrasound was performed, on 13-Nov-2013 a X-ray was done and on 02-Jan-2014 she underwent a MRI scan. She has an appointment on 23-Jan-2014 at Hospital and will receive answers for MRI scanning. At the time of reporting, the patient had not recovered. Symptoms had a high extent. She was still on sick leave from her job, and could not even perform the daily chores such as washing dishes, changing bed linens, go shopping, vacuuming etc. While shampooing could hurt at times, and blow drying could not be done without severe pain afterwards. Even when she bicycled she got severe pain in both elbows. Her normal workout has also stopped long ago. The patient had received GARDASIL via not reported route into not reported site of administration on 15-Sep-2012 (D1, batch number H011751) and on 06-Jun-2013 (D3, batch number not reported). Toleration was not reported. Noteworthy: There is a discrepancy regarding start date of pain in the left arm. HA coded 17-Jan-2013 in the structured field but mentioned that pain in the left arm started around February 2013 in the narrative. There was a number missing for a date in the narrative: '21-May-201' (incomplete year stated by the HA, but presumably 2013).

523759-1,"This literature marketed report as received from a physician refers to a 4 year old girl who had received her first dose of VARIVAX (Merck) in March 2009. She was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in March 2011. At that time, she was varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive. On 10-APR-2012, the girl was exposed to a mildly ill cousin who developed a varicella rash 2 days later (12-APR-2012). The episode was reported to the child's oncologist after 13 days. The girl was prescribed 7 days of oral acyclovir (manufacturer unknown) and concurrently began her scheduled chemotherapy, which included a 5-day course of dexamethasone (manufacturer unknown) (prednisone equivalent dose of 23 mg/day). Twenty-two days after her varicella exposure (01-MAY-2012) the girl was taken to an emergency department for fever and abdominal pain. She was treated symptomatically; her caretakers were instructed to discontinue chemotherapy and to follow up with her oncologist. Two days later on 03-MAY-2012 the girl returned to the emergency department with a generalized rash. She was hospitalized and treated with intravenous acyclovir (manufacturer unknown) and antibiotics. However, she developed multi-organ failure and died on 07-MAY-2012. Varicella was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing, and no alternative diagnoses were found for her acute illness. This patient's fatal varicella likely was the result of profound immunosuppression, resulting in part from the chemotherapy and corticosteroid treatment. Additional information has been requested."
523971-1,"This case was reported by the foreign regulatory authority (reference LY20140152) and described the occurrence of a possible dermo-hypodermitis in a 13-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with CERVARIX. The subject had no relevant medical history. On 12 September 2013, the subject received a 1st dose of CERVARIX (batch unknown, intramuscular, administered in the right upper limb). On 13 September 2013, the subject presented with a severe local reaction at injection site, on right upper limb associated with vomiting (without fever) for 1 week, loss of appetite with a weight loss of 3-4 kg in a month. Symptoms improved with symptomatic treatment with DOLIPRANE and SMECTA. Regression of the local reaction was noted but a hypopigmentation persisted at injection site, probably post inflammatory. On 16 October 2013, the subject received a 2nd dose of CERVARIX (batch unknown, intramuscular, administered in the right arm). There was no local reaction but nausea recurred in the immediate follow-up (positive rechallenge). In November 2013, about 15 days after administration of the second dose, the subject presented with lesions on lower limbs described initially as hematomas, with an extensive phase of about 8 days, associated with abdominal pains. From November to December 2013, several flare-ups were reported almost daily, mainly on lower limbs. According to the mother, it was initially nodular, infiltrated lesions which spontaneously resolved in about 10 days. Investigations at hospital were performed and included normal complete blood count, C-reactive protein, thyroid stimulating hormone, liver function tests, blood creatinine, CH50 complement factor, C3 and C4 complement factors and negative tuberculosis test Quantiferon and anti-nuclear antibodies. Activated partial thromboplastin time was increased at 42 seconds. On 28 November 2013, abdominal pains persisted with a feeling of hypoesthesia of internal side of left calf. Abdominal ultrasound scan was normal. Other coagulation tests could not explain this increased activated partial thromboplastin time. An improvement was noticed in December 2013 followed by a recurrence at the beginning of January 2014 with fluctuating ecchymotic, slightly indurated and painful lesions on lower limbs. No diarrhea was reported, a regression of nausea (appetite resumed after a weight loss of 3 kg) was noticed, abdominal pains on right flank were present. On 27 January 2014, at dermatological consultation, flare-ups were improved with persistence of 3-4 improved residual lesions of non infiltrated ecchymotic type on lower limbs. Diagnostic suggested was acute dermo-hypodermitis of erythema nodosum type. The regulatory authority reported that the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention) as medical advice and repeated investigations were needed. At the time of reporting, injection site reaction with sequelae and dermo-hypodermitis/erythema nodosum type was improved. According to the foreign method of assessment, the regulatory authority assessed the causal relationship of vaccination with CERVARIX with the reported events as dubious."

527882-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of brain stem inflammatory lesion in a 20-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with HPV2 (manufacturer unspecified), meningococcal vaccine. The subject had no family or personal medical history. On an unspecified date the subject received unspecified dose of HPV vaccine (unknown route), unspecified dose of meningococcal vaccine (unknown route). Lot numbers not provided. On an unspecified date, 1 month after vaccination with HPV vaccine, 2 months after vaccination with meningococcal vaccine, the subject presented with a right hemifacial spasm and hypoesthesia in the V-II region (at right). This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. Cerebral MRI showed a extended right protuberantial lesion, inflammatory type, without associated subtentorial abnormality. Lumbar puncture and all immunological, infectious, and neoplastic investigations were strictly normal. The clinical outcome was slowly favourable. Association between vaccination and demyelinating events is controversial. Numerous cases of central nervous system lesions (multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), are listed following a vaccination. However no scientific evidence has been established to date and it is difficult to conclude whether this is a cause-effect relationship or just a temporal coincidence. The occurrence of inflammatory neurological event must lead to research a recent vaccination, which should be reported to better determine the balance risk-benefit of vaccine."

This report refers to a 58-years-old female patient who had a dog bite in the right forearm on an unknown date. On an unknown date, nine weeks after the dog bite, she attended her general practitioner (GP) and the local emergency department with painful paraesthesiae in her right hand and she given tramadol, thereafter she began to vomit, refused water and appeared fearful and agitated. The GP referred the patient to the local emergency department for further management (day 1) 7.9 mmol/L, creatinine 79 1/4mol/L and normal C-reactive protein. Saliva and skin biopsies from nuchal and bite sites subsequently tested positive for lyssavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA). Over the next few hours the patient The case was discussed with the Health Protection Agency; after an initial blood sample was taken. She received rabies vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: not reported, so conservatively coded as Rabies vaccine INN) and human rabies immunoglobulin and was transferred to an isolation room in the intensive care unit. On admission she demonstrated pronounced hydrophobia, she gagged and became agitated when water from the sponge dropped onto her bedclothes, or at sight of a cup of water. Initial examination showed dehydration, temperature of 37.9 degrees C, heart rate 120 beats per minute, blood pressure 171/90 mmHg, she was fully conscious. There was no abnormality on examination. Blood indices showed a mild neutrophilia, urea developed episodes of extreme agitation despite escalating doses of diazepam (2.5-7.5 mg intravenous, as frequently as every hour), when one episode became violent she was anaesthetized with standard dose of fentanyl, midazolam, propofol and rocuronium (the majority of elements of the Milwaukee Protocol were commenced). She received a drug-induced coma (which included propofol 200 mg/hr, fentanyl 200 mcg/hr and midazolam 20 mg/hr), neurotransmitter substrate replenishment and antiviral therapy (amantadine 200 mg bd). In addition she received nimodipine 60 mg, 4 hourly, sapropoetin 200 mg bd, vitamin C 500 mg and coenzyme Q10 100 mg bd. Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring was adopted. On day 3, she became hypotensive and was commenced on noradrenaline (10-30 mcg/min to maintain a Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) greater than 80 mmHg). Urine output was responsive, however stroke volume and cardiac output measurements by esophageal Doppler were not responsive, to fluid boluses. Ketamine sedation (45 mcg/hg/min) was introduced. Adrenaline was added to maintain MAP. By day 4, passive body warming was required for hypothermia. Ventilatory requirements increased. Escalating doses of ketamine (60 mcg/kg/min), fentanyl (300 mcg/hr) and propofol (70 mg/hr) were required to maintain sedation. Antibiotics were commenced following the suctioning of offensive sputum and evolving radiographic infiltrates. By day 5, progressive bilateral radiographic infiltrates accompanied worsening hypercapnia. Polyuria with an increasing serum Na was observed, and treated with esophageal Doppler-guided fluid optimization, nasogastric water and intravenous 5% dextrose. Glucose control was required. On day 6, paralysis (previously avoided due to risk of masking seizures) was achieved with atracurium (10-20 mg/hr) and nitric oxide introduced for intractable hypoxaemia. Escalation of adrenaline (to 80 mcg/min) was required for hypotension, cardiac output started to fall and remained unresponsive. Pupils were dilated and demonstrated sluggish reflex to light. Acidosis and multi-organ failure ensued and haemofiltration was commenced. On day 8, two episodes of bradycardia required atrophine. As nonadrenaline increased, hydrocortisone 50 mg qds and fludrocortisone 100 mcg od were started. On day 9, she"

Information regarding the other 4 patients are captured in case numbers 2014SA063502, 2014SA063511, 2014SA063512, and 2014SA063514. Verbatim from the abstract: Background: Fever, leukocytosis, and large local reactions following the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PS23) have been described only in isolated case reports in the adult literature. Such atypical reactions can pose difficulty to providers when determining management. Patients experiencing this noninfectious reaction may receive unnecessary treatment if the diagnosis of robust inflammatory response to the PS23 vaccine is not considered. Observations: This is a clinical case series of 5 adult patients who received the influenza and PS23 vaccines and experienced a cellulitis-like reaction, fever, and leukocytosis in the days following vaccination. Four of the five patients received the influenza and PS23 vaccines in the same arm. The patient who received the vaccines in opposite arms had the local findings in the arm that received the PS23 vaccine. All 5 patients sought care and 4 were admitted to the hospital for observation or treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Conclusions: This case series highlights potential side effects of the PS23 vaccine that are not well described in the adult literature. Antibiotics were not helpful in treating these patients' local and systemic symptoms. Patients with histories consistent with that highlighted in this case series may avoid antibiotics and hospitalization if their providers recognize these symptoms as a noninfectious reaction to the PS23 vaccine. A 43-year-old female patient (referred to as ""patient 4""), received the following vaccines on an unspecified date: a left arm injection of Influenza Vaccine (manufacturer and lot number not reported); a right arm injection of Tdap (manufacturer and lot number not reported); and a left arm injection of Pneumococcal (Polysaccharide) (23 Serotypes) Vaccine (manufacturer and lot number not reported) The patient had a history of asthma. Within 24 hours of vaccination, she experienced systemic symptoms including fever of 102.8 degree Fahrenheit and rigors, with local inflammation including erythema, swelling, and warmth. Within three to four days post-vaccination the local reaction extended well beyond the immediate injection area. She sought medical care for her symptoms, and was found to have significant leukocytosis with white blood count of 22. She was not admitted to the hospital; treatment was not reported. Within five to seven days all systemic symptoms had resolved, and the patient experienced improvement of skin findings. Documents held by sender: None."

To OR for laparoscopic, possible open reduction of intussusception with incidental appendectomy. 11 week old male presented with emesis and hematochezia. Malrotation and pyloric stenosis were ruled out with upper GI. Ultrasound showed intussusception, which was unable to be reduced by contrast enema. The patient was therefore taken to the operating room for laparoscopic exploration. Intraoperatively it was found that his intussusception had already reduced. Appendectomy was performed incidentally. Post-operatively, the infant had 2 normal stools and consistently passed gas. He tolerated regular feeds and was discharge home with parents, who are well aware of signs to watch for should he develop recurrent intussusception."

532388-1,"This medically confirmed literature report (initial receipt 15-May-2014) concerns a 33-year-old female patient. The patient had a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis. On an unspecified date, the patient received influenza vaccine injection (manufacturer and batch number not provided) and PS 23 injection (manufacturer and batch number not provided) for immunosuppressive therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. Both vaccines were received in the same arm. On an unspecified date, within 1 day of vaccination, the patient developed fever greater than 101.5 degree Fahrenheit. The patient had maximum temperature of 101.8 degree Fahrenheit. She developed rigors, erythema, edema and warmth of the pneumococcal and influenza injection site. The patient had local swelling, severe redness and swelling and large local inflammatory reaction. The local reaction expanded well beyond the immediate injection area by day 3-4 post vaccination. The patient sought care within 2-3 days of vaccination. The patient was admitted to the hospital for observation with or without treatment for presumed cellulitis. The patient received full course of antibiotics to cover for common skin flora as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. She had received several different antibiotics due to worsening of skin erythema despite aggressive intravenous antibiotic therapy. She had a significant leucocytosis with white blood cell count at 19.2 K/ul with the predominance of neutrophils. She also had elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 71 mm/hr and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 14 mg/dl. Within 5-7 days, the patient improved in the skin findings and there was resolution of the systemic symptoms. The outcome was reported as recovering. Reporter's comments: The reporter stated that the local reaction experienced by the patients who received both influenza vaccine and PS23 in the same arm was due to PS23 vaccine rather than the influenza vaccine. The patient experienced fever and systemic symptoms with local erythema within 24 hours of PS23 administration and this timing is not consistent with a secondary infection of the injection site. In addition, the patients who were treated with antibiotics did not improve as would be expected if these local reaction represented cellulitis infection."

No pertinent medical history and concurrent conditions reported. On an unknown date the patient was vaccinated with GARDASIL (dose not reported). No other concomitant therapies reported. Consumer stated that this vaccine was safe and effective which the consumer did not believe that it was. The consumer's child had become very sick (hospitalization) because of this vaccine and her life has been altered in a negative way because of this 'safe' vaccine. The patient experienced psoriatic arthritis (hospitalization) that was not present before she received the vaccine. The consumer reported that the healthy daughter spent 4 months laying in bed, barely able to eat because she suffered from severe fatigue (disability, hospitalization) (days after receiving her vaccine). The consumer stated that the child went from healthy and active to sleeping 22 hours a day (hospitalization), not able to eat (hospitalization) and having to withdraw from school. The consumer stated that after 3 hospital stays, months of testing and finally fighting with the physician that something was wrong (as they said no even with 4 negative Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) tests), she was referred to a rheumatologist who had seen causes like this a lot lately. The consumer further stated that the patient was now suffering from arthritis in her back which was not there at her last well check at the end of 2013. The consumer had blindly allowed the doctor to talk the consumer into allowing the child to receive this vaccine without researching it. If the consumer had known that there are high risks for this vaccine and the fact that people with a family history of autoimmune based disorders (lupus, thyroid, RA, psoriasis, etc) should not receive this vaccine because of the increased risk of developing an AI (Autoimmune) disorder that can alter the child's life forever. The consumer would speak out and let everyone know not to vaccinate their child with this GARDASIL or anything like it. The outcome of the events was unknown. The causality of the events was unspecified. This is one of several reports received from the same reporter. Additional information has been requested."
546148-1,"Information has been received from Sanofi Pasteur MSD (SPM) (MFR#GB-1577272925-E2014-08821) on 29-SEP-2014. Case retrieved from the literature on 18-SEP-2014. This case is linked to E2014-08820 as the reporter was the same. Summary Objectives: To establish the workload expected as a result of introducing antenatal antivirals for the prevention of vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus. Methods: Retrospective review of all HBsAg-positive women and their infants, between 2005 and 2011, in a large (population 1 million) teaching trust in a highly ethnically diverse city. Results: 7% of pregnancies occurred in women who were taking, or would now be recommended to take, antenatal antivirals. 176 infants were born to 140 HBsAg-positive women through 172 pregnancies (mean 29 pregnancies/year). Two (1.1%) were vertically infected, including one born to a mother with HBeAg negative/HBeAb positive disease and HBV viral load 2 million IU/ml who would not currently be recommended for antenatal antivirals. 81.1% infants completed all HBV vaccinations; 79.5% completed serology testing. 96.4% women were referred to the hepatitis clinic, but 30% disengaged from clinic follow-up, with no significant difference between ethnic groups in terms of maternal disengagement, or failure to complete infant vaccinations or serology testing. Conclusions: Only a small percentage of HBsAg-positive women are likely to meet the newly published criteria for antenatal anti-viral treatment. Strengthened community engagement across multiple ethnic groups is of paramount important to improve maternal and infant outcomes. A 13 month old child of unreported sex, no concomitant medication reported, received a four-dose hepatitis B vaccination schedule (manufacturer unknown, batch number not reported), site and route not reported on unreported dates. The patient received hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth, together with all vaccines, and first had serology checked at 13 months of age when hepatitis B infection was detected. The patient's mother presented with hepatitis B e antigen positive/hepatitis B e antibody negative infection with HBV viral load >10^8 IU/ml at 3 months gestation. She didn't receive antiviral treatment during pregnancy as she had normal liver function tests and the use of antivirals to prevent vertical transmission had not been introduced. At this time of reporting, the outcome was unknown. Upon medical review, the case was considered serious and other medically significant."

The patient was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome at another hospital. The reporter's comment: The patient developed food allergy at approximately 3 months after the second dose of GARDASIL, but as the causal relationship to the vaccine was not suspected, the third dose was administered. Subsequently the patient was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; however it was unknown whether there was a causal relationship to the GARDASIL. The reporting physician considered that food allergy was serious due to hospitalization. The reporting physician felt that the causal relationship of food allergy to GARDASIL was unknown. The reporting physician considered that the fish was the other causative factor for food allergy.

GB-MHRA ADR 22710847. The case is not medically confirmed as it was reported by a consumer. An 80 year old female (weight 60.77 kg), with no medical history reported, received an injection of ZOSTAVAX (batch number not reported) dose in series, route and site of administration not reported, on an unreported date. On 27-Aug-2014, the patient experienced uncontrollable shaking which was, according to the reporter, a possible shock she felt freezing cold and her body felt hot. On the same day, the patient slept 3 hours in the afternoon and then she couldn't get warm in bed, she was nauseous and had no appetite. The patient couldn't drive home and was scared. On an unreported date, 5 days after the vaccine, the patient presented with cystitis and was treated with antibiotics for a week. According to the reporter, the cystitis was a result to the shock. The nurse who vaccinated the patient told her that ZOSTAVAX was meant for patient under 80 years old but, as there was one dose left, she vaccinated the patient, as it was a favor. The nurse did not mention possible side effects and thought it was a good idea despite the patient was 80 years old. The patient recovered on 31-Aug-2014. The patient received concomitant treatment with thyroid. ZOSTAVAX is not contraindicated for patient over 80 years old but HA decided to code ""inappropriate age at time of vaccination"" as adverse event. Upon medical review, the company judged relevant to add the adverse event ""cystitis"" which was mentioned in the narrative and not coded by HA. At the time of reporting, the outcome for cystitis was unknown and the patient had recovered with sequelae from all the other adverse events. The case was considered as serious due to be medically significant."
552972-1,"Initial and follow-up information has been received from a physician concerning a 16 year old female patient with no underlying/concomitant diseases, medical history and allergy who on 21-MAR-2012 was intramuscularly vaccinated with GARDASIL, batch number 9QN03R, lot number 0277AA, expiration date not provided, injection, 0.5 ml once a day for the third time; indication and strength not reported. Other concomitant medications were not reported. On 26-SEP-2011, the patient received the first vaccination with GARDASIL, batch number 9QN02R, lot number 0108AA, expiration date 26-JAN-2014, 0.5 ml injection, intramuscularly. On an unspecified date, the patient received the second vaccination with GARDASIL, batch number 9QN02R, lot number 0108AA, expiration date 26-JAN-2014, 0.5 ml injection, intramuscularly. On 21-MAR-2012 the patient received the third vaccination with GARDASIL, batch number 9QN03R, lot number 0277AA, expiration date not provided, 0.5 ml injection, intramuscularly. In December 2012 (approximately 9 months after the third vaccination of GARDASIL), the patient developed shoulder pain at first, and subsequently experienced numbness and pain in lower extremities. She also had pain and movement disorder (onset of pain, movement disorder and shoulder pain). On 29-OCT-2013, the patient experienced numbness in the left upper arm (onset of numbness and paralysis in left lower and upper extremities). On 30-OCT-2013, numbness and paralysis in left upper and lower extremities were noted. Detailed examinations were performed at the internal medicine department of Hospital A, but the cause was unknown. In November 2013, the patient recovered from numbness and paralysis in left lower and upper extremities. On 16-May-2014, the patient developed pain in left upper and lower extremities, paralysis in left upper and lower extremities and difficulty in walking. She visited Hospital B. On 19-AUG-2014, the patient recovered from pain in left upper and lower extremities, paralysis in left upper and lower extremities and difficulty in walking. On 07-OCT-2014, the patient developed low back pain, numbness of upper and lower extremities and pyrexia. She was visiting Hospital C. On a unspecified date, the patient developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea. As of the time of report on 16-OCT-2014, the patient had not recovered from pain, movement disorder, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and pyrexia. The outcome of shoulder pain, numbness and pain in lower extremities was unknown. As of the time of the report on 22-OCT-2014, the outcome of low back pain, numbness of upper and lower extremities, pyrexia and shoulder pain was unknown. The patient had not recovered from pain, movement disorder, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Reporter's comment (ver. 0010: although he wished to tell the patient and her parents that there was no causal relationship to the GARDASIL, considering their feelings, he told her parents that he acknowledged that she had symptoms. Reporter's comment (ver. 002): the causal relationship was considered to be remote since the patient had complained of the symptoms more than 1 year after the vaccination. The reporting physician considered numbness and paralysis in left lower and upper extremities, pain in left upper and lower extremities, paralysis in left upper and lower extremities, low back pain, numbness of upper and lower extremities, pyrexia, pain, movement disorder were non-serious. The reporting physician did not assess the seriousness of difficulty in walking, shoulder pain, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Upon internal review, numbness and paralysis in left lower and upper extremities and left upper and lower extremities were considered to be serious due to other important medical event. The reporting physician felt that numbness and paralysis in left lower and upper extremities, pain in left upper and lower extremities, paralysis in left upper and lower extremities, low back pain, numbness of upper and lower extremities and pyrex"
553311-1,"I had an incidental interaction w/patient this AM at approx. 8:30 AM, following the monthly staff meeting where she asked me ""if she's supposed to tell me about a ""reaction"" she got from the flu vaccine"" (I confirmed she did receive the vax here on 10/14/14 at approx. 5 AM - as she recalls). I asked her if she reported it thru her PCP and she said she had called to report her symptoms but they did not want to see her - it is unclear to me when she placed this call to her MD office in response to her symptom development. She reports the following symptoms with the approximate time of presentation: - ""Itching"" - developed 1 hour (6AM) after flu vax given - did not report this to RN on duty - ""Hives"" - developed 2-3 hours (7-8 AM) after flu vax was given - did not report this to RN on duty - Weakness and Numbness in her Left Arm (site of injection) ""by the time she got home"" - she could hardly open the door to her vehicle"" - did not report to this nurse until 11/12/14 and is resolved. - Temp of 101 (I did not verify w/her that this was not 100.1, but 101) - developed at Midnight the following night after the vaccine was administered, while here at work. She states she reported this to her supervisor, and another staff RN gave her TYLENOL while here at work to treat the fever and she continued to work her shift. - She denies being sick the day of the injection; Denies allergy to eggs, egg products or chicken feathers, gelatin, or thimerosal. - She reports her only allergy as AUGMENTIN. Patient was asked to contact her PCP to assure that they hadn't followed up by completing VAERS reporting (based on her report, it was unsure to me if she actually spoke to the office, was seen by a provider or not) and to let me know if this was not reported, b/c of the need for follow up with VAERS. She agreed to do so and get back to me. She returned to my office approx. 20 minutes later and said she had called her Dr and per her ""they have no report in her file of her having called in to report these symptoms"". I did verify with her that she did NOT go any urgent care of ED for treatment of anaphylaxis. She states she did not. She does not admit to taking any medication post vaccination (Ex: BENADRYL to treat symptoms, only TYLENOL). She denied any long lasting adverse effects at this time and reports she is back to baseline."
556860-1,"Initial information has been received from a physician via the regulatory authority (# V14000480) concerning an 82 year old male patient. Patient had a history of antivenom administration for pit viper bite to the left hand (29-JUL-2006). Patient current condition included hypertension, periarthritis and osteoarthritis (bilateral periarthritis scapulohumeralis and gonarthrosis). There was no remarkable family history. On 06-OCT-2014, at around 10:00 am, the patient received the first dose of PNEUMOVAX NP (MSD) injection drug (batch number: 9MQ07R; lot number: 0000223222, Expiration Date: unknown, dose not reported, route: parenteral). Concomitant medication included BLOPRESS and ARTZ DISPO. The patient's body temperature prior to the vaccination was 35.3 degrees C. On 14-OCT-2014, at 9:00 a.m., the patient presented to the reporting hospital with fatigue and inappetence. The patient had a fever of 37 degrees C. Blood test revealed an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) to 17.7 and drastic decreases in platelets and blood cholesterol to 40000 and 106, respectively. The patient was transferred and admitted to hospital (platelets decreased and abnormal CRP developed). On 20-OCT-2014, the patient was discharged from the hospital. At the time of this report, the outcome of platelets decrease and abnormal CRP were unknown. Reporter's comment: Unlike other vaccine recipients, the patient had a history of antivenom therapy and thus it was suspected that the therapy might have been involved in the events. The reporting physician considered that platelets decreased and abnormal CRP were serious due to hospitalization. The reporting physician felt that platelets decreased and abnormal CRP were related to PNEUMOVAX NP and did not assess the other possible causative factors for the events. Information has been received for a direct report from the regulatory authority regarding a case provided by physician. Additional information has been requested."
556870-1,"This case was found during archiving activities and has not previously been entered into the global safety database. The case was processed using procedural documents and current labeling documents. This spontaneous report was received from a physician, via a company representative and concerns a 26 year old male; local case ID: 199402114BW. The subject's weight and height was not reported. The subject's medical history included: epididymitis beginning 1982 (Left side) and severe cold. The subject received typhoid vaccine oral ty21a (capsule, hard, unknown) 1 dose once a total, on 21-SEP-1992, 23-SEP-1992 and on 25-SEP-1992 as prophylactic vaccination. Non-company suspect drugs included: cholera vaccine as prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported. On the day of vaccination the subject experienced from flu-like symptoms. On 22-SEP-1992, one day after the first dose of typhoid vaccine oral ty21a vaccination the subject experienced myalgias, diarrhea, back pain and stomach cramp. Later he experienced weakness and a feeling of paresis of his left arm. On 11-0CT-1992, the subject received Lariam (mefloquine hydrochloride) for malaria prophylaxis for 10 weeks. On 15-0CT-1992, the subject was administered with 5 ml of Beriglobin (Human Immune Globulin). On 18-0CT-1992, the subject started his 5-week-trip. During the trip, all complaints reoccurred except the neck pain. End of 1992, the subject developed myalgia again after an influenza infection. On an unspecified date in 1993, recurrent infection of the upper respiratory system, mycosis of the gastrointestinal tract and inter digital mycoses. It was reported that the subject's recurrent diarrhoea with stomach pain was at irregular intervals. Since AUG-1993, the subject experienced intermittent occurrence in irregular intervals of stabbing muscle pain, especially on exertion. Duration of the episode was between 3 and 5 days (maximum 14 days). Additionally nausea, abdominal complaints, vertigo and swollen lymph nodes on the throat was noted. At the time of reporting, the subject had remittent stabbing pain in muscles and joints of short duration and sensitiveness to pressure after this episode. Several apparative and laboratory examinations were carried out during the hospital stay. The subject was hospitalised for clarification of the myalgia and arthralgia in suspicion of fibromyalgia and for exclusion of sarcoidosis. A neurologic konsiliar examination showed a slight anisocoria left bigger than right and an increase in cholesterol with 220 mg/dl was found. The creatinine-kinase value was reported to be slightly increased (but no pathological value provided). Records revealed that several HIV tests were negative; a CD4/CD8 quotient of 0.89 (normal value of quotient is at 2 + / - 0.5). A drop under 1 speaks for the presence of a secondary immunodeficiency. Action taken with typhoid vaccine oral ty21a and cholera vaccine was not applicable. The subject outcome was not reported for flu-like symptoms, nausea, vertigo, swollen lymph nodes, diarrhea, back pain, stabbing muscle pain, asthenia, paralysed feeling in arm, stomach cramp, increased cholesterol and drop in CD4/CD8 quotient. The reporting physician considered the events of back pain, stabbing muscle pain, asthenia and paralysed feeling in arm to be unrelated to typhoid vaccine oral ty21a. This report was serious (permanent disability, hospitalization)."
560445-1,"Fatigue and muscle aches began on 9/26/2014. Still feel this way to date.  My cognitive processing began to get slower.  I have had a hard time concentrating.  On 10/19/2014 intense vertigo began at 11am.  Never had vertigo before.  Stayed in bed until 10/21/2014 at 3:30am when I had to have my wife who was still dealing with double vision possibly from the same vaccine, take me to Emergency Room.  I was admitted overnight as the anti-vertigo medicines were not working well.  I was discharged at 5:30 pm on 10/22/2014, still experiencing some vertigo as well as pressure in my head and ears.  To date I still have the pressure in my head, I cannot think quickly and feel like my central nervous system is out of whack.  Neuropathy began on both of my feet on 09/26/2014.  I still have this.  I have muscle twitches occuring since the vaccine.  On 12/04/2014 my heart went into a severe  arrhythmia sending me back to the ER.  The Dr's shocked my heart three times with no results.  They proceeded to do an emergency catherization which showed no blockages, but put my heart back into normal rhythm after a wire passed over my heart.  The Dr's are still not sure what caused the problem and said they can't rule out the vaccine, but it would be hard to prove.  I have had a red rash on my face on and off since the vaccine.  I was a healthy, strong male prior to getting the two Twinrix vaccines.  I am concerned about the pressure in my head I still have.  Could it be encephalitis?  Or something similar?  Dr's cannot find an answer for me or my wife who also had the vaccines and now severe health issues."
563285-1,"Patient is a previously healthy 4 year old boy who presented with new-onset seizure in the setting of one month altered behaviors, fevers, and cough. On 12/15 patient received the MMR, VZV, and DTaP-IPV vaccines (verified in CAIR). Soon after he developed fever, cough, and rhinorrhea. These symptoms lasted for approximately 2 weeks, resolving 12/30 or so. On 1/12 symptoms returned again with fever and cough. He became fatigued and moody, refusing to get out of bed much, seeming weak and refusing to walk. Fevers were daily, both daytime and nightime and with associated chills/sweats. He saw his pediatrician about a week later and was diagnosed with viral illness. On Thursday 1/15 he again saw his pediatrician, was diagnosed with possible ear infection, and prescribed ""ear drops."" On Saturday 1/17 he developed rapid, fast breathing and had emesis x1. He presented to ED and discharged home with Tylenol for presumed viral illness. Around 4 PM the day of admission (1/22) pt and mom were at auntie's house. After eating some soup and water pt had emesis x 1 (NBNB) and seemed to slump down in chair. He was breathing differently, as if trouble breathing. Mom asked if he could see her and he said it was hard to see. He then seemed confused and was difficult to understand. Soon after, eyes seemed to roll up into his head and his upper and lower extremities became stiff. Parents called EMS at that point and he was brought to ED. In addition to daily fevers and cough for the last 3-4 weeks, patient has also had intermittent abdominal and back pain as well as headache. He has seemed extra sensitive, occasionally complaining that walking is painful, and seems to be walking more slowly than usual. He has had normal appetite and apart from two episodes of emesis (x1 on 1/17 and x1 on 1/22) he has had no other vomiting or diarrhea. No rashes. Parents do report weight loss, dad estimates approximately 8 pounds, despite no change in appetite.  In the past month parents have also noticed changes in patient's behavior overall. He has been more moody and fatigued than usual, intermittently confused. Specifically, in addition to the episode that occurred on 1/22 just prior to admission, mom recalls him waking up around 5 AM on 1/19 confused and asking ""Where am I?"". Mom was able to re-orient him at that time. Patient arrived to ED seizing and was given Ativan. Labs were sent, CXR and CT head done, and he was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir at meningitis dosing. He was then admitted to the PICU. Since arrival to the PICU he has had brain MRI which showed 3 small enhancing (necrotizing?) lesions. He was initially intubated for airway protection but has since self-extubated himself. Additional labs were sent. He has required precedex drip as well as other medications for sedation. He was continued on antibiotics sent from the ER, and started on oseltamivir as well."
564723-1,"Information has been received from the authors in a published article. Background and objectives: All measles-containing vaccines are associated with several types of adverse events, including seizure, fever, and immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). Because the MMRV vaccine compared with the separate MMR and MMR + V vaccine increases a toddler's risk for febrile seizures, we investigated whether MMRV is riskier than MMR + V and whether either vaccine elevates the risk for additional safety outcomes. Methods: This was a cohort study that included children aged 12 to 23 months who were members of 8 Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) sites from January 2000 through June 2012 and who received PROQUAD (Merck) or separately administered, same-day M-M-R II + VARIVAX (Merck) vaccines. Nine study outcomes were investigated: 7 main outcomes (anaphylaxis, ITP, ataxia, arthritis, meningitis encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Kawasaki disease), seizure, and fever. Comparing MMRV with MMR + V, relative risk was estimated by using stratified exact binomial tests. Secondary analyses examined post-MMRV or MMR + V risk versus comparison intervals; risk and comparison intervals were then contrasted for MMRV versus MMR+V. Results: A total of 123 200 MMRV doses and 584 987 MMR + V doses administered to children 12 to 23 months old from 2000 to 2012 were evaluated. Overall, rates for the 7 main outcomes during postvaccination risk intervals were low, with several outcomes having few or zero events in the risk interval after either vaccine. Estimated risk differences between MMRV and MMR + V were not statistically significant for any of the 7 main outcomes, although it was for seizure, comparing MMRV with MMR + V, the risk difference that can be ruled out with 95% confidence ranged from 0.5 case (Kawasaki disease, days 1-28) to 35 cases (ataxia, days 1-42) per 100 000 MMRV doses. In the primary analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in risk between MMRV and MMR + V during either the focal or broad risk interval for the 7 main outcomes. Analyses of seizures after October 2008 confirmed that MMRV, compared with MMR + V, was associated with a twofold increased risk 7 to 10 days after vaccination. Secondary analyses comparing risk versus comparison intervals after MMRV or MMR + V revealed an increased risk of ITP and a decreased risk of ataxia after both vaccines. Analyses also detected an increased risk for anaphylaxis after MMRV. This result was based on only 2 cases, neither of which was confirmed as acute anaphylaxis after chart review; both diagnoses were related to a history of allergic reactions. Similar to the primary analysis, there were no significant differences in risk for the 7 main outcomes during any risk interval comparing MMRV with MMR + V. After MMR + V, the risk of ataxia was significantly lower during the risk interval. For the remaining outcomes, risk differences that can be ruled out with 95% confidence ranged from 0.08 case (arthritis) to 11 cases (ITP II, days 1-42) per 100 000 MMR + V doses. Similarly, ataxia risk was significantly lower after MMRV. For the remaining outcomes, we could rule out risk differences that ranged from 0.5 case (Kawasaki disease, days 1-28) to 10 cases (ITP I, days 1-42) per 100 000 MMRV doses. Case-centered analyses demonstrated a significantly increased risk of seizure and fever 7 to 10 days after both MMRV and MMR + V and confirmed that MMRV, compared with MMR + V, was associated with a significantly higher risk for seizure and fever 7 to 10 days after vaccination. Conclusions: This study did not identify any new safety concerns comparing MMRV with MMR + V or after either the MMRV or the MMR + V vaccine. This study provides reassurance that these outcomes are unlikely after either vaccine. This report refers to 7 patients aged 12 to 23 months of unknown gender who enrolled in this study.

The patient's concurrent disease(s) included penicillin allergy. The patient had been received nasal FLUMIST started on 29-Aug-2006. The patient experienced Guillain Barre syndrome which started on 30-Aug-2006. Patient admitted to hospital on 02-Sep-2006 with bilateral upper and lower extremity (ascending) weakness, calf pains and intermittent tingling of feet. Vital signs normal, antalgic gait, walks only with assistance. Diagnosed with variant of Guillain Barre, treated with IV Immune Globulin. Remains in hospital, but transferred from ICU to medical ward. Abnormal study electrophysiologic evidence of severe motor greater than sensory acquired multifocal sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy with axonal greater than demyelinating features. Given the history this likely represents GBS. The prognosis for recovery with predominant axonal features would probably be a protracted course. Presented with progressive weakness and numbness in hands and feet time 3 days. Weakness began first then tenderness in his gastrocs and numbness working its way distal to proximal up to his elbow and knees. History of productive cough since beginning of basic training. No fever, chills or night sweats. Exposed to others with diarrhea but he has not had diarrhea. Hospital course continued to have weakness in lower extremities mainly feet, also decreased grip strength with no change during ICU stay. Treated with IVIG for 3 days. No change in neuro symptoms or respiratory function transferred from ICU to medical floor and subsequently discharged. At the time of reporting, the event of Guillain Barre syndrome was ongoing. The reporter considered the event of Guillain Barre syndrome to be serious due to hospitalization. Diagnostic test details are available."

Serious criteria included GSK medically significant. Additional event(s) included hepatitis B in 2008 with serious criteria of GSK medically significant. The outcome of vaccination failure was unknown. The outcome(s) of the additional event(s) included hepatitis B (recovered/resolved). It was unknown if the investigator considered the vaccination failure and hepatitis B to be related to Hepatitis B vaccine. Relevant Tests: On an unspecified date in 2008, approximately 16 years after the vaccinations, a patient's blood donation was screened and he was found to be positive for hepatitis B DNA but negative for hepatitis surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibodies. The patient's initial blood screening was negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibodies; hepatitis B surface antibodies at this point were negative and the hepatitis B DNA level was 11 IU/ml. On follow-up, the viraemia was estimated to have lasted from 45 to 69 days and he developed hepatitis B surface antibodies (100 IU/L) within 45 days and hepatitis B core antibodies after 69 days. According to the authors, this pattern corresponded with an anamnestic response. The alanine aminotransferase level was 7 to 16U/L after that. The viral genotype was identified as C2 with 20 clones sequenced and 20xsG145R, sV184G and W199 stop substitutions on S protein. The authors commented that the patient and his partner's sequences of the presurface and surface regions of the hepatitis B surface antigen gene were nearly identical at nucleotide and amino acid level. Diagnostic results (unless otherwise stated, normal values were not provided): In 2008, Alanine aminotransferase result was 7 to 16 IU/L, Hepatitis B DNA assay result was 11 IU/ml, Hepatitis B core antibody result was Negative absent, Hepatitis B core antibody result was Positive absent, Hepatitis B surface antibody result was 100 IU/L and Hepatitis B surface antigen result was Negative absent.

Patient had anaemia from Jan2015 and ongoing, ongoing hypertension for 40 or 50 years. Concomitant medication included amlodipine for blood pressure decreased from 2013 at 10 mg daily and from Nov2014 at 5 mg daily and ongoing, Vitamin D3 orally for low Vitamin D and lack of sun at 1000 units once a day from 2015 and ongoing, lisinopril for heart orally at 40 mg, 1x/day (at night) from 2010 and ongoing and atenolol for heart at 50 mg twice a day from 1990 and ongoing, garlic 1000mg and vitamin B2 50 mg. Patient specified he was taking amlodipine in the morning and that 7 days prior to the injection, he was told to cut the amlodipine down from 10 mg daily to 5 mg daily. 50-60 years before, the patient received cholera vaccine and had poisoning and body reaction as he got a big bubble. On 10Jan2015 lab tests were done with the following results: triglycerides and glucose were good and high density lipoprotein level was a little low. On 18Jan2015 patient got rash on his legs, internal itching effect on whole body, rough skin and was retaining fluid in ankle and calves. Events ""rash"" and ""itching"" were treated with Prednisone and he took BENADRYL which helped to hold down the itch a little bit. The patient visited a physician, who told him about the possibility that the retaining fluid could be caused by his blood pressure medication. Amlodipine decreased from 10 mg to 5 mg helped to decreased the fluid level a little bit. ""Fluid retention"" as considered serious as it led to hospitalization. Outcome for ""rough skin"" and ""Fluid retention"" was not recovered; patient recovered from the other events. The reporting physician stated that the patient mentioned he got the vaccine about 2 months before the report and then had the rash 1 month later. However the physician was not sure if it was related to the vaccine and was not aware of the reported adverse events.

Concomitant products included CRESTOR. In November 2014, the patient received FLUARIX (intramuscular). In November 2014, less than a month after receiving FLUARIX, the patient experienced injection site injury, injection site inflammation, muscle weakness upper limb and muscle pain. The patient was treated with NAPROSYN. On an unknown date, the outcome of the injection site injury, injection site inflammation, muscle weakness upper limb and muscle pain were recovering/resolving. The reporter considered the injection site injury, injection site inflammation, muscle weakness upper limb and muscle pain to be almost certainly related to FLUARIX. Additional details provided as follows: The patient reported that he now knows that since receiving FLUARIX he has developed a chronic problem with his left deltoid. He clarified this problem as an injury. He often lifts weights vigorously and the FLUARIX has caused him not to be able to lift like he normally can. The injured area was inflamed and it has been hurting. The patient in particular has problem lifting weights that involves overhead movements. He has been seeing a physical therapist at least three times a week, has been self-medicating with NAPROSYN, and has been stretching. It does now seem better since beginning physical therapy. They have told him that the injury was with the middle deltoid tendon and a little bit of the interior. The reporting physician was wondering if there was an alternative route of administration because he does not plan on receiving in the deltoid again."
579818-1,"Information has been reported in a published literature article, concerning a 59 year old male who had undergone thymectomy and received a total radiation of 62 Gy (Gray) over six weeks following surgery. The patient later developed and sought treatment for generalized urticaria. Initial evaluation revealed a low absolute lymphocyte count (615 cells/microliter), prompting further analysis. The patient's immune globulin levels, CD4 and CD8 counts and antigen response to a polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine were monitored for several months. To prevent opportunistic infections, the patient was placed on BACTRIM prophylaxis. Although the patient's IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were unremarkable, the patient failed to respond to 11 of 12 serotypes of the PNEUMOVAX 23 (strength, dose, dose #, lot #, route and application site were not reported). The patient's low CD4 lymphocyte count and failed response to pneumococcal vaccination were consistent with immunodeficiency. After radiation alone, a recovery of T lymphocytes were usually observed after about three weeks. Even a year later, the patient still had not made a full recovery of T-lymphocytes suggesting a possible role of the adult thymus in immune recovery. To prevent serious complications, the authors reported that it was necessary for patient's who underwent radiation to be closely monitored for immunodeficiency, especially if they had undergone thymectomy as well. Follow up information has been received on 19-MAY-2015 from Sanofi Pasteur MSD. Follow-up information was received in published literature. It describe the longitudinal progress of the male with a thymectomy for a microinvasive thymoma involving the capsule. The patient tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus. His lymphocyte counts 87 months after thymectomy and 85 months after radiation therapy were as follows: absolute lymphocyte count 956 cells/mel, absolute CD3+/CD4+ 164/mm3 (16%) and absolute CD3+/CD8+ 257/mm3 (25%). The patient was able to discontinue BACTRIM prophylaxis after 9 years of treatment. Over the course of 8 years, the patient had still not made a full recovery according to laboratory markers, which seemed to have stabilized at chronically low levels. Additional information is not expected. Reporter's information, lab data, product information, AE and narrative were updated."

626195-1,"Information has been received from a published literature article. Introduction: Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) was defined by the presence of HBV DNA in patient sera in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult HBV had been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, reactivation during immune suppression, and transmission to others. While the hepatitis B vaccine was very effective at preventing chronic HBV infection, recent studies indicated it was less effective at preventing occult HBV following infant vaccination. No studies, however, had examined the efficacy of adult HBV vaccination at preventing occult HBV. Here, it was presented the first report of occult HBV following adult vaccination. Case presentation: In November 2012, a 21-year old woman was admitted to a medical center with tricuspid valve endocarditis secondary to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus which was complicated by non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 15%). She reported active use of intravenous drugs. The patient tested positive for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), with initially undetectable HCV RNA and subsequent low-level viremia. The patient was anti-HBs positive, anti-HBc negative, and HBsAg negative consistent with her reported history of prior vaccination with HBV vaccine (detail information unknown) as part of a nursing training program several years prior to her hospital admission. Despite a persistently negative HBsAg, HBeAg was positive, and HBV DNA was detectable in three separate serum samples. During the course of the hospitalization, the patient seroconverted to become anti-HBc positive. She received no antiviral medications and, at follow-up six months later, she was found to be HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive, and no longer had detectable HBV DNA, indicating that her occult HBV infection had resolved. Conclusions: HBV vaccination in infancy was effective at preventing chronic HBV infection but was less effective at preventing occult HBV infection. Similar studies examining the efficacy of adult HBV vaccination in preventing occult HBV had not been performed. This case highlighted the importance of carefully determining the HBV status of high-risk individuals, as vaccination history and the presence of antiHBs might not be adequate to rule out HBV infection, even in the absence of HBsAg. Additional information has been requested."

On an unknown date, the outcome of the heart disorder and circulatory insufficiency were fatal and the outcome of the vomiting, pneumonia, screaming, impatience and feeding disorder were unknown. The reported cause of death was circulatory insufficiency and heart disorder. It was unknown if the reporter considered the heart disorder, circulatory insufficiency, vomiting, pneumonia, screaming, impatience and feeding disorder to be related to ENGERIX B pediatric. Additional information was provided as follows: At 6 weeks of age, the patient received hepatitis B vaccine (brand unknown, but according to reporter's relation in July 2013 this batch of that vaccine was withdrawn from market due to uneven texture). After a few days, the patient stopped suck from breast but was hungry and shouted impatiently. Shortly after that the patient started vomiting. One week after vaccination , the patient was transported to the hospital. The suspicion of pneumonia was established. On an unknown date, X-ray picture showed enlargement of heart, whereas echocardiography showed heart damage. The coronarography excluded congenital heart disease. It was concluded the patient need heart transplantation. On an unknown date, at the age of 4 months, the patient died of circulatory insufficiency due to heart damage was determined as cause of death."

631973-1,"Initial unsolicited literature report received from a physician on 16 June 2015. This case is linked to 2015SA092506, 2015SA092507, 2015SA092508, 2015SA092509, 2015SA092510, 2015SA092511, 2015SA092512, 2015SA089479, 2015SA092722, 2015SA092723, 2015SA092724 (same vaccine). Abstracts: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pregnancy outcomes of women who received Tdap vaccination at or after 32 weeks of gestation. Outcomes from consecutive pregnancies during which the mother received Tdap were also analyzed. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study at a single institution, we compared pregnancy outcomes between those who accepted or declined Tdap at 32 weeks of gestation. Additionally, women who received Tdap vaccination in this and a prior pregnancy in the past 5 years were compared with multiparous women who only received Tdap in this pregnancy. RESULTS: Since 2013, 7,378 women who were offered the Tdap vaccine antenatally delivered at our institution: 7,152 accepted (97 percentage). There was no difference in stillbirths, major malformations, chorioamnionitis, 5-minute Apgar score, or cord blood pH. Neonatal complications including ventilation requirement, sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and neonatal death were also similar. However, preterm birth rates at 36 weeks of gestation or less (6 percentage compared with 12 percentage, P less than 0.001), incidence of small for gestational age (10 percentage compared with 15 percentage, P equal to 03), and length of neonatal hospitalization (3.9 compared with 4.7 days, P less than 001) were all significantly increased in the unvaccinated cohort. No difference in neonatal outcomes was noted between women who were administered at least two Tdap vaccines in the past 5 years (n equal to 1,229) and those who received only a single dose (n equal to 4,159). CONCLUSION: No adverse pregnancy outcomes were identified in association with antepartum Tdap vaccination. This remained true in women receiving more than one Tdap vaccine in a 5-year timeframe. This may be the result of a type II error. A 7,378 number of female patients out of which (97 percentage) patients received Tdap vaccine and 226 (3 percentage) patients declined Tdap vaccine. A 7,152 number of female patients, whose medical history and concomitant medication were not reported had received a dose of TDAP (batch number, expiration date, dose, dose number, route and site of administration were not reported) on an unspecified date. As Tdap vaccine was exposure in utero, thus 526 numbers of neonate patients out of which 99 (1 percentage) patients gestational age at delivery was 34 or less weeks and 427 (6 percentage) patients gestational age at delivery was 36 or less weeks. Laboratory investigation and corrective treatment were not reported. At the time of this report, the outcome of the event was unknown. Documents held by sender: none."

The following is verbatim from the article: Background: Reporting of adverse events (AEs) following vaccination can help identify rare or unexpected complications of immunizations and aid in characterizing potential vaccine safety signals.We developed an open-source, generalizable clinical decision support system called Electronic Support for Public Health-Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (ESP-VAERS) to assist clinicians with AE detection and reporting. Methods: ESP-VAERS monitors patients' electronic health records for new diagnoses, changes in laboratory values and new allergies following vaccinations. When suggestive events are found, ESP-VAERS sends the patient's clinician a secure electronic message with an invitation to affirm or refute the message, add comments, and submit an automated, prepopulated electronic report to VAERS. High-probability AEs are reported automatically if the clinician does not respond. We implemented ESP-VAERS in December 2012 throughout the Health System, an integrated healthcare system. We queried the VAERS database to determine Health's baseline reporting rates from January 2009 to March 2012 and then assessed changes in reporting rates with ESP-VAERS. Results: In the 8 months following implementation, 91 622 vaccinations were given. ESP-VAERS sent 1385 messages to responsible clinicians describing potential AEs. Clinicians opened 1304 (94.2 percent) messages, responded to 209 (15.1 percent), and confirmed 16 for transmission to VAERS. An additional 16 high-probability AEs were sent automatically. Reported events included seizure, pleural effusion, and lymphocytopenia. The odds of a VAERS report submission during the implementation period were 30.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 9.52-95.5) times greater than the odds during the comparable preimplementation period. Conclusions: An open-source, electronic health record-based clinical decision support system can increase AE detection and reporting rates in VAERS. Keywords: Vaccine; immunization; adverse reaction; reporting; adverse event. This case involves patient (age and gender not reported), who was vaccinated with a dose of Dtap-ipv (manufacturer: unknown, batch number, expiration date, dose, dose in series, route and site of administration were not reported), a dose of Hepatitis A (manufacturer: unknown, batch number, expiration date, dose, dose in series, route and site of administration were not reported) and a dose of MMRV (manufacturer: other, batch number, expiration date, dose, dose in series, route and site of administration were not reported) on an unspecified date.

Isthmus of normal size (5 mm), hypoechogen and without detectable nodule. Normal left lobe (volume at 6cm3). Similar echo-structure was found for parenchyma. Vascularisation was increased in both lobes. Results compatible with auto-immune thyroiditis. Hypothyroidism within a context of thyroiditis was established. Post-vaccinal cause was evoked. Levothyroxine was started on 21 Feb 2016. Evolution was unknown. The patient was willing to travel round the world. She consulted at the infectious department at hospital. She had received several doses and vaccines. The patient had received ENGERIX B on 09-DEC-2015 IXIARO on 09-DEC-2015 VACCIN RABIQUE PASTEUR on 09-DEC-2015 vaccine rabique Pasteur on 16-DEC-2015. The patient's outcome was reported as Unknown. Sender's Comments: Thyroiditis is unexpected following yellow fever, hepatitis A, rabies, typhoid and diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis vaccinations. Time to onset is not suggestive of a role of the vaccination. Auto-immune thyroiditis was suggested based on results of examinations (thyroid ultrasound). Additional information on patient's medical history as well as results of aetiological investigations such as TSH level, T3 and T4 levels, anti-anti-TPO and anti-Tg antibodies detection are needed to further assess this case. To be noted that the patient received several suspect vaccines, making it difficult to assess the role of one vaccine in particular."

635731-1,"This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician via the Regulatory Authority Agency. Regulatory authority report number: HU-OGYI-050516. A 11-week-old female patient received PREVENAR 13 (lot/batch number L74388, expiry date 31Dec2017) on the left thigh and PENTAXIM (Sanofi Pasteur, lot number M4049-1, expiry date 30Jun2017) on the right thigh both intramuscularly on 01Apr2016 at 0.5 ml single. The patient was fed with MILUPA HA infant formula until the age of two weeks, then was switched to PREGOMIN due to colic and posseting, no rashes appeared that time. Many close family members have asthma in her family. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced fever at 38.5 degrees C and vaccination site reaction on 01Apr2016, 2-3 hours later the vaccination with PREVENAR 13 and erythema, oedema, and maculopapular rash all over the body on 04Apr2016. The patient received NUROFEN and the fever resolved on the same day. The patient recovered from vaccination site reaction on 03Apr2016. Cold compress was applied on the oedema, which resolved on 04Apr2016. The patient recovered from erythema and maculopapular rash all over the body on 04Apr2016. Clinical course: On 04Apr2016 at 11:00 infant formula was changed from PREGOMIN + thickening agent to MILUPA AR. At 17:00 maculo-papular rashes appeared all over the body. Erythema and oedema developed, particularly on the face and neck region. The paediatrician assessed the symptom as anaphylactic shock due to food. She was given CALCIMUSC solution for injection 0.5 ml orally, which did not improve the symptoms. SUPRASTIN injection 0.3 ml (6mg) intramuscularly was administered, the symptoms resolved within 2-3 hours. Infant formula was immediately switched back to PREGOMIN+thickener. The case was investigated by the Regulatory Authority Agency. No errors regarding the storage, transportation and administration of the vaccine were found. The investigator was of the opinion that due to the change in infant formula on the same day the oedema, erythema and rashes started, causality with PREVENAR 13 and PENTAXIM could not be assessed. Sender's comment: Erythema, oedema, rashes, fever and vaccination site reactions are known adverse events, listed in the SmPC of PENTAXIM and PREVENAR 13. Based on the plausible temporal relationship, causality between PREVENAR 13 and PENTAXIM and fever is considered possible. Based on the localisation and the specific phenomenon of vaccination site reaction, causality with PREVENAR 13 is considered certain, causality with PENTAXIM is considered unlikely. Since the change of infant formula occurred on the same day before the oedema, erythema and rashes developed and in line with the reporter's diagnosis these events were likely caused by the infant formula rather than the vaccines. Causality with PENTAXIM and PREVENAR 13 is considered unlikely. The case is considered serious based on the medically significant event oedema of the face and neck. No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected."

639950-1,"I administered the Boostrix vaccine under a protocol with Dr. through pharmacy on 06/10/16. I did counsel the patient before administration on the potential side effects of the vaccine. I observed the patient after administering the vaccine and he did not report any adverse effects at that time. Patient called me on 06/14/16 to report and adverse reaction, wondering if it was from the vaccine. Patient said on 6/12/16 in the morning his immunized left arm and right leg were sore. Then that evening, hard lump under the skin developed (Dr. described as ""local skin reaction"" per phone call after examination 06/17/16 4:47pm) at injection site and then on knuckle on middle finger. Patient reported these reactions to me 06/14/17. I let his regular physician know about the reaction. She said he had an appointment scheduled friday 6/17/16 anyways and they would check on his reaction then. Dr. said it was difficult to tell if the lumps were from the vaccine itself, but that it could be a local skin reaction. He said there was no abcess or anything like that. He said it may be due to sensitization of the skin. Patient said he is no longer sore and that the lumps are healing. Additionally, our refrigerator went out of range on Friday June 3, 2016. It got up to 50 degrees F, and was out of range for 1 hour and 30 minutes. I called GlaxoSmithKline Manufacturer on 6/6/2016, and they faxed us information stating ""From the time the vaccine arrives at the healthcare professional's (HCP) facility/pharmacy until it is administered, a maximum cumulative time of 168 hours is permitted for the vaccine to be at temperatures above 8 degrees Celsius through 25 degrees Celsius (above 46F through 77F).

(Same literature). The following is verbatim from the article: Background: Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The risk of anaphylaxis after vaccination has not been well described in adults or with newer vaccines in children. Objective: We sought to estimate the incidence of anaphylaxis after vaccines and describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed cases of anaphylaxis. Methods: Using health care data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink, we determined rates of anaphylaxis after vaccination in children and adults. We first identified all patients with a vaccination record from January 2009 through December 2011 and used diagnostic and procedure codes to identify potential anaphylaxis cases. Medical records of potential cases were reviewed. Confirmed cases met the Brighton Collaboration definition for anaphylaxis and had to be determined to be vaccine triggered. We calculated the incidence of anaphylaxis after all vaccines combined and for selected individual vaccines. Results: We identified 33 confirmed vaccine-triggered anaphylaxis cases that occurred after 25,173,965 vaccine doses. The rate of anaphylaxis was 1.31 (95 percent CI, 0.90-1.84) per million vaccine doses. The incidence did not vary significantly by age, and there was a non-significant female predominance. Vaccine-specific rates included 1.35 (95 percent CI, 0.65-2.47) per million doses for inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (10 cases, 7,434,628 doses given alone) and 1.83 (95 percent CI, 0.22-6.63) per million doses for inactivated monovalent influenza vaccine (2 cases, 1,090,279 doses given alone). The onset of symptoms among cases was within 30 minutes (8 cases), 30 to less than 120 minutes (8 cases), 2 to less than 4 hours (10 cases), 4 to 8 hours (2 cases), the next day (1 case), and not documented (4 cases). Conclusion: Anaphylaxis after vaccination is rare in all age groups. Despite its rarity, anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening medical emergency that vaccine providers need to be prepared to treat. This case involves a 56-year-old male patient who was vaccinated with a dose Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (manufacture unknown) and with a dose of TDAP (manufacture unknown) (batch number, dose, route and site of administration was not reported) on an unspecified date. Medical history reported as other (amoxicillin allergy) and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, 60 to less than 90 minutes following the vaccination, the patient had experienced angioedema, Shortness of breath (SOB), vomiting, fatigue and anaphylaxis.

Additional details were provided as follows: The patient had no medical history, allergic history and concomitant medicines. The case was reported by the patient's mother. The age at vaccination was not reported. On 4th August 2016, at 11:00 hours, the patient received ENGERIX B pediatric on left upper arm. In the evening at about 22:00 hours, the patient experienced fever. The patient took MEILIN (ibuprofen, a non-GSK product) for fever, but the temperature did not decrease to normal. The patient also experienced two-time transient abdominal pain and two-time transient blindness on the same day. On 5th August 2016, the patient went to the hospital, but no treatment was taken. On 6th August 2016, the patient went to the hospital again as her fever was still lasting. The patient performed a routine blood examination and the result showed HS-CRP (high-sensitivity c-reactive protein) value was 85 which was elevated (normal range 0-10). The patient received outpatient treatment of unknown drug by transfusion. Till the time of reporting, the fever was resolved, but the reporter was worried whether the fever would recur again. The event of tonsil fester was relieved and the HS-CRP had not been re-examined yet. The reporter suspected that the ENGERIX B pediatric which the patient was injected was counterfeit and the local counterfeit department had been reported."

663354-1,"I took my daughter to her 12 year old check up. Decided to start the series of the HPV vaccinations after several conversations with my health care provider. The nurse injected her left arm with the HPV then the flu shot on her right arm. Within seconds her eyes rolled back, arms and legs started to convulse, and she passed out for about 5 to 10 seconds. Doctor came back into the room. Patient reported not knowing or remembering what had happened and reported she was feeling okay ~no other symptoms were reported. While in observation by two nurses and doctors and after about 10 minutes after the first seizure she seized again for about 25 seconds. Hit her head against the wall, eyes rolled back, and started to convulse. She then appeared to stabilized; she was transported to ER. EKG results show minor abnormality~ going to meet with Cardiologist and Neurologist for follow up. As a parent, it was the most horrific experience I have had. My emotional reaction is that I am angry and so disappointed that there was no discussion about the possibility of seizures and or precautions taken at the time of the injection. Needless to say, Patient will not complete the series of the shots. I will do whatever I need to do to inform the public and to help to ensure precautions are taken in the future by health care processionals administering the shot. I don't know if there are long term neurological implications. I wish their was an antidote to the HPV. I am praying my daughter will be okay. She is smart, beautiful, social, enjoys soccer and studying about current events. She is emotionally and physically healthy."
664851-1,"Initial unsolicited report received from the literature on 29 October 2016. This case is linked with 2016SA200331, 2016SA200332, 2016SA200333, 2016SA200334, 2016SA200335, 2016SA200336, 2016SA200337, 2016SA200338, 2016SA200339, 2016SA200340, 2016SA200341, 2016SA200342. (Same literature article) The following is verbatim from the article: Abstract: Disinfection should be required for all skin penetrative procedures including parenteral administration of vaccines. This review analyses medically attended infectious events following parenteral vaccination in terms of their microbiological aetiology and pathogenesis. Like 'clean' surgical site infections, the major pathogens responsible for these events were Staphylococcal species, implicating endogenous contamination as a significant source of infection. As 70% isopropyl alcohol swabbing has been shown to effectively disinfect the skin, it would be medico-legally difficult to defend a case of sepsis with the omission of skin disinfection unless the very low risk of this event was adequately explained to the patient and documented prior to vaccination. There was a significant cost-benefit for skin disinfection and cellulitis. Skin disinfection in the context of parenteral vaccination represents a new paradigm of medical practice; the use of a low cost intervention to prevent an event of very low prevalence but of significant cost. This case involves a 11 year old male patient who was vaccinated with a dose of FLUZONE Quadrivalent and with a dose of PNEUMOVAX (manufacturer: other) (batch number, expiration date, dose, dose number, and site of administration were not reported for both vaccines) both by parenteral route on an unspecified date. No comorbid health issues, medical history were reported. Concomitant medications was not reported. On an unspecified date in the morning, one day following the vaccination, patient developed right arm pain, the arm had swelling, erythema, pain and discolouration. On an unspecified date, post vaccination, patient had necrotizing fasciitis. The wound cultured pseudomonas was thought to be a colonizing bacteria. As corrective treatment patient had 2 debridements and skin grafts for necrotizing fasciitis. Outcome of the event was not reported. Upon internal review the case was considered as serious because of important medical events: Necrotizing fasciitis. Documents held by sender: none. Sender's Comments: This case corresponds to a poorly documented literature report with a mention of Developed Necrotizing fasciitis post vaccination and Inflammation localized in arm with skin discoloration in a 11 years old male who had received INFLUENZA QUADRIVAL A-B VACCINE and PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE. It was reported that Patient had 2 debridement's and skin grafts, wound cultured pseudomonas thought to be a colonizing bacteria. In this case site of vaccination and site events are not mentioned specifically. Clinical details- such as latency from vaccination, medical history, previous vaccination history and diagnostic work-upare lacking to allow adequate medical assessment."

The patient experienced Acute respiratory infection and Lower respiratory tract infection (Microbial culture negative) on an unknown date. The patient was admitted to hospital on an unspecified date. The patient had a medical history of RHEUMATOID ARTHITIS. The patient had received Metotrexato and Prednisone. This patient was within a prospective study in a cohort of 294 patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, included in the vaccination program: seasonal flu vaccine (October to April), pneumococcal (combined regimen 13-valent and 23-valent) and Haemophilus influenzae B. Patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for infections, especially respiratory type. Immunization is a recommended measure to reduce these complications. Among all 294 patients, only 42 were not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy: 147 were treated with DMARD'S (Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs) and 98 were with TNFa inhibitor. Regarding the ARI (acute respiratory infections), before inclusion in the vaccination program, 20 (7%) patients in the cohort studied had been admitted into the hospital for this reason. During follow-up, and subsequent immunization, only 6 of the 287 patients (2.1%) had ARI, including this patient. The patient's outcome was reported as Unknown. Sender's Comments: Latency is unknown in this case, it is not possible to consider it a vaccination failure. Pneumococcal vaccine being inactivated, it cannot cause an infection. The patient had a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, her immune system may thus be weakened because of immunosuppressive therapy with methotrexate and prednisone. Exact latency and additional information on patient's immune status at the time of vaccination is necessary to assess the case."

On an unknown date, 4 days after receiving Flu seasonal TIV Dresden, the subject developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Serious criteria included death and GSK medically significant. Additional event(s) included unwell. The outcome of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was fatal. The outcome(s) of the additional event(s) included unwell (unknown). The reported cause of death was thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and unwell may have been caused by Flu seasonal TIV Dresden. Additional information was provided. This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in a 28-year-old patient of unspecified gender who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown). The patient was a part of the report that summarised national passive surveillance data for adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) reported to the Administration to 28 February 2013. The report focused on AEFI reported for vaccines administered during 2012 and trends in AEFI reporting over a 13-year period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2012. AEFI were notified to the Administration by state and territory health departments, health professionals, vaccine manufacturers and members of the public.

No information on patient's family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; dosages unknown; batch number not provided). On an unspecified date, 2-3 days post vaccination, the patient became unwell. Subsequently, the patient developed TTP. 2 days after onset of symptoms, the patient died. The cause of death was documented as TTP. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed. This case has been considered serious due to death. The author stated that the death was temporally associated with receipt of vaccines. The death was investigated by the Administration and no clear causal relationship with vaccination was found. Treatment was unknown. The authors suspected the event of TTP related to unspecified influenza vaccine. The authors concluded that ""The total number of reported AEFI in 2012 was reduced by 22% compared with 2011. Reports of ISR following DTPa-IPV at 4 years decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 but remained higher than in previous years. Reporting rates for most of the vaccines were similar to 2011 or lower in 2012, particularly in the 2 to less than 7 year age group. The majority of AEFIs reported to the Administration were mild transient events and the data reported here are consistent with an overall high level of safety for vaccines included in the NIP schedule"".

The following is verbatim from the article: Introduction there have been isolated case reports of medication product mix-ups involving insulin unintentionally given to patients when the intent was to administer vaccines. Information on how and why these types of errors occur is limited. Objective To describe incidents of unintentional administration of insulin instead of influenza vaccine and identify possible causes for errors. Methods we describe a 2014 investigation of an apparent mix-up where a cluster of five adult patients unintentionally received insulin instead of influenza vaccine. We also searched Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine and drug safety monitoring databases from January 2005 to April 2015 in order to identify other incidents. We classified cases as either 'highly suggestive' or 'suggestive' of insulin and influenza vaccine mix-ups. Results Investigation of the primary cluster incident revealed deviations from recommended practices for storage, handling, preparation, and administration of drugs and vaccines; the five cases were classified as highly suggestive of insulin and influenza vaccine mix-ups. Our search of CDC and FDA vaccine and drug safety monitoring databases identified an additional two highly suggestive and 15 suggestive cases, for a total of 22 cases (7 highly suggestive and 15 suggestive) during the 10-year study period. Conclusion Insulin and vaccine mix-ups have the potential to cause serious harm to patients, and are preventable with proper training and application of standards. Our investigation indicated that improper storage including inadequate segregation of insulin and influenza vaccine products in clearly labeled containers or bins lack of standardized procedures for confirming the contents of vials, and decreased vigilance in preparation and administration likely contributed to the primary cluster incident. This case involves a 47-year-old female patient who was administered insulin NOS injection (manufacturer: other, batch number, expiry date, route and site of administration: not reported) instead of receiving a dose of INFLUENZA VACCINE (manufacturer: unknown) on an unspecified date in 2005. Patient had no known history of diabetes mellitus. Patient's other medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. On an unspecified date in 2005, one hour post administration of insulin, the patient experienced light headedness, dizziness, asthenia, profuse sweating, slurred speech and loss of coordination, hypoglycemia (blood glucose level was 37 mg/dL that was revealed from lab data). Patient was hospitalized for two days. Medical records documented possible medication error in differential diagnosis. It was a case of wrong drug administered (unintentional administration of insulin instead of influenza). Other laboratory was not reported. Corrective treatment was not reported. On an unspecified date, patient recovered from the events and was discharged from hospital. List of documents held by sender: none.

After the first vaccination, subject developed headache and temporary pain and could not raise her arm. After the third vaccination, from the end of May 2011, slight fever persisted and her period pains were aggravated. There were often times when she did not remember her own behavior. In July 2011, with a sudden onset of convulsive seizure at night, she was emergently transported to a hospital. She later revealed that she did not recall this incident. She was diagnosed with idiopathic convulsion and was placed on therapy with medications. Seizure is under control owing to medications; however, epileptic symptoms, generalized convulsion, loss of consciousness, loss of memory ability, and decreased mental concentration have not improved. Due to physical deconditioning, she gave up going to a senior high school of her first choice and decided to go to a local school where she can commute from home. She tended to be absent from school. She tried to attend classes despite the difficulty of her condition, and managed to acquire credits necessary for graduation. Yet, she had to give up going to a college of her choice and went to a private junior college instead. Even at present, her epileptic symptoms, generalized convulsion, loss of consciousness, loss of memory ability, and decreased mental concentration persist, which often cause sudden physical deconditioning during the class. A document released by the local community triggered her to receive CERVARIX; however, it resulted in the current conditions she suffers from. The postvaccinal conditions put her in constant anxiety over the deterioration of her health and her future."

675967-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of osteomyelitis in a 4-year-old female subject who received INFANRIX. Co-suspect products included VARIVAX. On an unknown date, an unknown time after receiving INFANRIX, the subject developed osteomyelitis. Serious criteria included GSK medically significant. Additional event(s) included staphylococcal infection with serious criteria of GSK medically significant, fever and pain. The outcome of osteomyelitis was unknown. The outcome(s) of the additional event(s) included staphylococcal infection (unknown), fever (unknown) and pain (unknown). The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the osteomyelitis, staphylococcal infection, fever and pain may have been caused by INFANRIX. Additional information was provided. This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Osteomyelitis in a 4-year-old female patient who was vaccinated with INFANRIX (GlaxoSmithKline) and VARIVAX (Merck). The patient was a part of the review that analysed medically attended infectious events following parenteral vaccination in terms of their microbiological aetiology and pathogenesis. No information on patient's family history or medical history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received INFANRIX and VARIVAX in right leg (administration route unspecified; dosages unknown; batch number not provided for both). On an unspecified date, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient developed fever and pain. The patient underwent surgery to aspirate infection in bone which revealed staphylococcal infection of unknown species. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis. The source and mode of spread was reported to be contiguous. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not reported. The authors did not comment on the relationship of osteomyelitis with INFANRIX. The authors concluded that ""Evidence based medicine has been championed as a paradigm which results in improved medical practice. However, it is evident from the body of data collated in this review that very large randomized trial would be needed to adequately address the issue of skin disinfection prior to vaccine administration and the prevention of sepsis. Consequently, a new paradigm might be evoked to cover this clinical issue, namely the use of a very low cost intervention (disposable skin swab) to prevent a very low prevalence event (sepsis related to parenteral vaccination) of high cost (medical attention including hospitalisation with morbidity/mortality)"". This is 1 of the 7 valid cases reported in the same literature article."
675980-1,"This spontaneous report as received from a physician refers to a 3 month old infant of unknown gender with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and cytomegalovirus infection. There was no concomitant medication reported. On 06-OCT-2016, the patient was accidentally vaccinated with ROTATEQ, 2ml, orally (lot # was not reported). Bloody stool occurred in the evening of the same day (the patient developed Enterocolitis). In 2016 (afterwards), the patient developed Enterocolitis encephalopathy besides Enterocolitis. On 07-NOV-2016, the patient was hospitalized. In 2016, a simple test (antigen test) turned out it was negative. On 10-NOV-2016, the patient was given cord blood transplant therapy as treatment for the SCID. At the time of this report, the outcomes of Enterocolitis and encephalopathy were unknown. The reporter's comment: The patient with immunodeficiency was mainly infected with cytomegalovirus, but because the patient was vaccinated, the physician thought there was still virus remaining. A simple test (antigen test) turned out it was negative, so if there was any virus in the patient's system, the physician thought it must have been a small amount. Because the symptoms occurred after taking ROTATEQ, there was suspicion of a causal relationship, but since the patient with SCID had a cytomegalovirus infection, it was possible that they were symptoms of that condition instead. Because the methods of the lab surveys were unclear, a judgment could not be made. The reporting physician considered that Enterocolitis and encephalopathy were serious due to hospitalization. The reporting physician considered that Enterocolitis and encephalopathy were related to ROTATEQ. Upon internal review, the events of Enterocolitis and encephalopathy were determined to be medically significant. Additional information has been requested."

On Sept 16 2005, he presented with pain in lower limbs which aggravated on Sept 17 2005. He did not walk any longer. As his general health status was altered and he was unable to walk, he was taken to the emergency department. Crepitant rales were noted on the right pulmonary side. He was hospitalized for pneumopathy and alteration of general health status. During the night between Sept 17 and 18 2005, he developed acute respiratory distress which required ventilation and intubation. As the child did not have any coughing and deglutition reflexes, he was taken to the intensive care unit. The physical examination showed that he had no tendon reflex in the four limbs, neither corneal nor abdominal reflexes. A diagnosis of polyradiculoneuritis was then made. He was intubated until Sept 28 2005. Then the extubation was normal and neurological recovery was good. When the child was discharged on Oct 07 2005, all reflexes were present, except for tendon reflex in the lower limbs, His general health status was good. A referral to day hospital was scheduled to deal with kinesiotherapy and motor activity. It was also noted that viral serologies were negative and that results for C. Jejuni search were pending. Further information is expected. This is a follow-up report(s) previously submitted on 12Oct05. Information has been received from a health professional concerning a 42-month-old male child with a history of pneumopathy (December 2004) and vericella (March 2005). Follow-up information was received on 20-OCT-2005 from a health professional which reported that the patient's vaccination schedule was up to date. On 17-SEP-2005 the patient experienced a deterioration of general health status and functional disability in lower limbs, which were considered as severe by the reporter. An acute polyradiculaneuritis like GUILLAIN-BARRE syndrome was diagnosed. On 12-SEP-2005 the child presented with hyperthermia due to rhinopharyngitis and acute otitis media. The patient's general practitioner started a treatment with ORELOX and CELESTENE. On 16-SEP-2005 he experienced pain with lower limbs. The day after, his general practitioner referred the patient to the ER as his general health status deteriorated and he experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, loose cough, and a functional disability in the lower limbs started. Physical examination showed crepitant rales on the right pulmonary side and severe asthernia. The patient was not oxygen dependent. The thorax X-ray showed a focus of middle lobe. Biological examinations were performed (see lab data). The patient was hospitalized in a pediatric department. During the night between 17 and 18 SEP-2005 the patient presented with repiratory distress and severe respiratory acidosis, which required ventialtion throughmask and the intubation. An absence of coughing and nausea reflexes was observed. The patient was then taken to an intesinve cre unit. The neurological examination revealed a hypotonia associated with tendon areflexia. The patient had corneal reflexes. A palsy of left cranial nerve was noted. Abdominal cutaneous reflexes, inhibitaion and cremasteric rectal reflexes were absent without anal gaping. The main possible diagnosis consisted of a respiratory distress due to GUILLAIN-BARRE acute polyradiculoneuritis. Additional examination were performed (see lab data). An EEG and nerve conduction velocity study showed the absence of sensitive responses in upper limbs and normal sensitive reponses in lower limbs. Absence of motor responses in 4 limbs with moderate extension of distal latency and moderate dimimuation of conduction speed. The patient was given TEGELINE 1 gram/kg during two days.

349960-1,"Initial report received on 15 June 2009 from a literature article search. The uniform use in foreign country of a single Hib vaccine in combination with DTaP, and IPV (DTaP.IPV/Hib) facilitates ongoing assessment of vaccine effectiveness, including any effects of recently added concurrent vaccinations and increasing time since vaccination. Surveillance at 12 pediatric centers in 2004-2007 indicates that vaccine failures remain rare and case totals approach an irreducible minimum, with no age shift. In foreign country, recommended childhood vaccines are supplied free of charge to providers and children by the provincial governments. Since 1998, all provinces have supplied the same vaccine to prevent Hib infections, a PRP-T conjugate given in combination with DTaP, and IPV (DTaP.IPV/Hib, PENTACEL, Sanofi Pasteur Vaccines). The standard schedule recommends doses at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. The uniformity of Hib vaccination during this time affords an unusual opportunity to observe the ongoing effectiveness of the combination vaccine, including any influences of coadministered vaccines (eg, pneumococcal conjugate) recently added to the infant immunization schedule or any indication of waning immunity with increasing time since immunization. The program has actively monitored Hib admissions at 10-12 hospitals since 1994. The 12 current centers account for over 90% of foreign country's tertiary care pediatric beds and admit over 75,000 children annually. Retrospective surveillance identified a preimmunization era (1985) annual total of 485 Hib cases, roughly half of the national total reported for children. By 1994, Hib admissions at centers totaled only 24, as a result of diverse programs with several conjugate vaccines. During 1998-2003, when all provinces used the same DTaP.IPV/PRP-T vaccine, we reported annual case totals ranging from 3 to 16 (period average 8.8 cases). Most cases involved unimmunized or incompletely immunized children. The number of vaccine failures after 3 or 4 doses was remarkably uniform at 1-3 per year, with one-third occurring in immunocompromised children. During 2004-2007, provincial program uniformity remained and program surveillance continued as previously described. Case-finding involved reviews of laboratory data and discharge diagnoses. Cases had a positive culture from a normally sterile site. Immunization history was obtained for each case, mainly from provider records. Cases were categorized as local (from the metropolitan area served by a center) or referred (from beyond the metro area). The incidence rate was calculated for local cases, using the 2004 census data for metropolitan area populations, age 0-16 years. A second incidence rate was calculated for local cases that occurred despite age-appropriate primary Hib vaccination. The center was excluded from incidence calculations for lack of a defined primary catchment area. Of the 25 cases reported, 11 were incompletely immunized infants <12 months of age, 4 were unimmunized children (>/=2 years of age), and 10 had completed age-appropriate primary immunization and represented vaccine failures. One failure in 2007 followed PROHIBIT (Connaught Laboratories) vaccination in 1992, in a 17-year-old with respiratory compromise. The remaining breakthrough cases had received PRP-T vaccine. Only 7 cases were local, arising from a population of 1,486,507 children 0-16 years old. Three of the 7 cases were failures after PRP-T vaccination. Thus, the overall incidence rate for Hib infection in 2004-2007 was 0.10 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.04-0.22) and the overall rate of PRP-T vaccine failure was 0.05 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.01-0.15). This case is for a 6 year old noncompromised patient, who had previously received a four dose series of PENTACEL (lot number not reported) and developed Invasive Haemophilus Influenzae Type b in 2005. The other cases of HIB infections following age appropriate immunization are discussed in 2009-02596,"
352130-1,"Initial case was reported as serious on 9-Jul-2009 by Health Authority (FI-NAM-20090545). It was reported that a 11-year-old female patient (initials and birth date not reported) with medical history of spherocytosis (onset date not reported) and splenectomy 5 years ago (exact date not reported) was vaccinated with a dose of PNEUMOVAX 23 (batch NJ17960, intramuscularly on her right arm, number in series not reported) on 30-Apr-2009. Concomitantly she was vaccinated with MENCEVAX ACWY (GlaxoSmithKline, batch A73CA191A, intramuscularly on her left arm, number in series not reported). During the next night from vaccination (onset date reported as 30-Apr-2009 by Health Authorities) the patient developed fever up to 40 degrees Celsius which was continuing. During the same night she had redness and swelling in her right arm at injection site (size: diameter about 8cm). The pain was also involved. Patient was hospitalized from 2-May-2009 to 3-May-2009. When the patient was examined by physician (on unspecified date) patient's general condition was reasonable. The patient's lung auscultation was normal and her throat was normal. She did not have any rigidity of the neck and there were so swollen lymph nodes in neck area. Despite the vaccination site patient's skin was normal. Patient was further sent to be examined by paediatrician. The ZINACEF (GlaxoSmithKline, batch not reported, dosage not reported) antibiotics were administered intravenously.

The patient had been nursing her baby since August 2008 and was still nursing at the time of the report. It was reported that the Pharmacy Technician was mixing up a lot of doses of ZOSTAVAX (Merck) for the pharmacists to administered in January 2009 while she was pregnant. Concomitant therapy included unspecified prenatal vitamin. The Pharmacy Technician stated that approximately around 29-JAN-2009 she experienced a fever, aches, flu like symptoms, itchy back, and rash and blisters appeared. The Pharmacy Technician saw her physician on 29-JAN-2010 and he prescribed VALTREX. The patient stated that she did not take the VALTREX because she was pregnant at that time and did not feel comfortable taking VALTREX. The Pharmacy Technician stated that it took about 5 weeks approximately around the beginning of March 2009 before all those symptoms resolved. The Pharmacy Technician stated that she had not mixed up any ZOSTAVAX (Merck) since this had occurred in 2009. The Pharmacy Technician reported that last Monday 22-MAR-2010 she started feeling itchy on the collarbone and neck and by Saturday 27-MAR-2010 she developed shingles type rash. The Pharmacy Technician requested information on how her physician could culture the blister, rash to determine whether the rash was wild type shingles or shingles from exposure to ZOSTAVAX (Merck) since when she experienced the blisters and rash in January 2009 no one had sent it out for analysis to determine the exact cause of the blisters and rash. At the time of the report the patient had not recovered. The patient was scheduled to see the physician on 29-MAR-2010. Fever, aches, flu like symptoms, itchy back, rash and blisters were determined to be an other important medical events for the reporter due to VALTREX prescribed. Additional information has been requested."
386240-1,"Information has been received from a published article. A cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study was conducted among nurses employed in surgical and genecological wards of 16 randomly selected hospitals. The objective of this cross-sectional sero-survey was to determine the vaccination coverage for hepatitis B and the prevalence of anti-HBC, an anonymous ser-survey of surgical/gynecologic nurses. This report was part of a post-marketing surveillance program. On an unspecified dates, the patient was administered two doses of RECOMBIVAX HB. On an unknown date, the patient experienced hepatitis B and was hospitalized. Of note, all staff infected with HBV without clinical manifestation of hepatitis B were vaccinated. It could be possible that some nurses were infected with HBV in the pre-vaccination era and were not tested for the markers of a previous infection before the immunization procedure. Another possible explanation of anti-HBc positive cases among those vaccinated for HBV is that some nurses were vaccinated, but did not respond. As the anti HBs titer was not checked after the vaccination course they were not aware of the fact they were part of a non-responder group. As they were still vulnerable to HBV, they contracted the infection. As shown conclusively by the study, some anti-HBC positive nurses might be vaccinated for HBV without previous screening, so clear recommendations for pre-vaccination screening should be established and strictly followed by those responsible for vaccination procedures. As the majority of the HBV nurses were not aware of their serological response after the immunization with hepatitis B vaccine, testing for anti-HBs after vaccination remains crucial. This data underscore the importance of Hepatitis B vaccination for health care workers. The study documents the ability to obtain 100% vaccination coverage in nursing staff, an important goal in reducing the risk of HBV infection in this and other healthcare worker population. No further information is available. This is one of several reports received from the same source."

This polymedicated patient with medical history of schizophrenia, hypertension and dyslipidemia was vaccinated with S-OIV FOCETRIA (batch number 0902201) on 04 Dec 2009. The patient had received seasonal flu vaccination (manufacturer and batch number unknown) on an unspecified date. On 23 May 2010, the patient developed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy consistent with Miller Fisher syndrome which led to hospitalization. The patient was showing diplopia and paresthesia of upper left limb as of date of this report. Final outcome of the events was reported as condition improving. Follow-up Health Authority received on 19 Oct 2010: This patient with medical history of schizophrenia since 1990, arterial hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, recurrence of bronchitis episodes and underwent surgery for inguinal hernia in 2009. It was reported that, it was not possible to establish precisely the date of administration of the seasonal vaccine due to the fact that the vaccine administered privately; presumably the administration occurred about the beginning of Nov 2009 because the patient went for administration of the pandemic vaccine in Nov 2009, but the administration actually occurred on 04 Dec 2009, four weeks after the seasonal vaccine. On 23 May 2010 diplopia and paresthesias of the hands, bilateral developed. On 25 May 2010, worsening of diplopia, onset of palpebral ptosis on the right eye, and hyposthenia of the left lower limb occurred. For these reasons the patient went to the emergency department. The patient was afterwards admitted to the hospital. During the hospitalization, brain computed tomography scan and brain magnetic nuclear resonance was performed and both exams were within the normal limits. A progressive worsening of the palpebral ptosis, which progressed bilaterally; onset of paresthesias in the left foot, and deviation of the rima oris was observed. The patient was therefore, transferred to the neurology department. At the time of the admission in the neurology department, the patient showed bilateral opthalmoplegia, peripheral deficit of the VII cranial nerve on the left side, mild deficit closing the right eye against strength, absence of segmental deficit of strength in the upper limbs, proximal hyposthenia of the left lower limb (2/5), and diffuse areflexia. There was no deficit of the discriminative sensibility on an unspecified date. Examinations performed during hospitalization showed, haemato-biochemical profile with normocytic anemia and haemoglobin 12.5 g/dl (versus 13.5-17.5), triglycerides was 203 mg/dl (versus < 150). The proteins electrophoresis was within normal limits. Evaluation of the cephalorachldian fluid and physical-chemical evaluation limpid aspect was as clear water, proteins 1.65 (versus 0.15-0.60), glucose 74 mg/dl (versus 40-70), chloride 121 mEq/L (versus 115-130), white cells 10 (versus < 4), index of link 0.68 (versus < 0.75), permeability barrier index 44 (mild barrier damage), albumin 991 mg/L (versus 150 273), IgG 191.8 (versus 24 45).

408214-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of hepatitis b in a 8-month-old female patient who received zidovudine (brandname/tradename unknown) for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Concurrent medical conditions included HIV encephalopathy and mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient also received HEBERBIOVAC 10ug at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of life. Co-suspect medication included Lamivudine (brandname/tradename unknown), Lopinavir + ritonavir, Ritonavir and BCG vaccine. Concurrent medications included Cotrimoxazole, Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol, Ciprofloxacin and Amikacin. Her CD4 count and HIV viral load prior to receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) were 0.78% and 690000 copies/ml respectively. On an unknown date seven weeks after starting anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, the patient received cART consisting of zidovudine (unknown), lamivudine, lopinavir/ritonavir boosted with additional ritonavir. Approximately six weeks after starting cART, she developed acute liver failure with hepatic encephalopathy (altered mental status, hepatic flap and seizures). Her baseline liver function tests were normal, but her alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase had increased to 2418 IU/L, 269 mmol/L, 112 mmol/L and 2942 IU/L respectively. Coagulopathy was present with an international normalised ratio (INR) of greater than 10, prothrombin time greater than 120s and partial thromboplastin time of 127s. A brain CT showed cerebral edema but no hemorrhage. Cerebral spinal fluid showed 420 lymphocytes/mm^3 with normal protein (0.34g/L), normal glucose (3.3 mmol/L) and cultures for bacteria and M. tuberculosis were negative. Toxicity to treatment was suspected and cART and TB treatment were stopped. She received supportive treatment consisting of fresh dried plasma, vitamin K, lactulose, fluid management and control of seizures and hypoglycemia. Hepatitis serology showed a positive surface Ag, core IgM and hepatitis B e Ag (HBeAg). Her CD4 level had increased to 6.6 % and her viral load was 13000 copies/mL. One month later, there was a slight improvement of the liver function tests (ALT 107 Iu/L, total bilirubin 158 mmol/L, direct bilirubin 92 mmol/L) and INR 1.63. She received non-hepatotoxic anti-TB drugs consisting of ciprofloxacin, amikacin and ethambutol. In addition, her cART drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin were also re-started. Unfortunately, her liver function deteriorated. She had a persistent coagulopathy which required multiple blood and fibrinogen degradation product transfusion and daily vitamin K injections. Despite reverting to less hepatotoxic anti-TB drugs again, the patient died three months later due to liver failure plus severe diffuse bleeding. Ten days prior to her death (and five months after starting cART), worsening of her right axillary lymphadenitis was noted. Chest x-rays showed hilar lymph nodes and bilateral patchy changes. Post-mortem analysis showed liver cirrhosis without granulomas or granulomatous lesions in the lymph node. Auramin stain and mycobacterial cultures were negative and the CD4 level was 6.5%. The author considered the events were related to treatment with Zidovudine, lamivudine and the other cART agents. They commented ""hepatotoxicity is common after initiation of cART in HIV-infected patients...hepatotoxicity generated minimal morbidity and was rarely fatal, but concomitant TB therapy and HBsAg significantly increased the risk of hepatotoxicity. Our patient had both risk factors for hepatotoxicity."" They also commented ""the less probable figure that the child horizontally acquired HBV after receiving three documented immunizations we could hypothesize HBV vaccine failure...we postulate that our patient developed IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) to HBV and BCG.

426317-1,"At both the 2 month and 4 month vaccination, my son experienced a seizure lasting approximately 10 seconds. Approximately 1 week after receiving shots he was fussy, ran a temperature, had poor coloring. My son experienced a seizure at his two month and four month vaccination. Both seizures occurred approximately 1 week after the 2 and 4 mth. vaccination. During this time, my son was fussy, ran a fever on and off ranging from 99 degrees to 102 degrees. His coloring was poor as he appeared pale. At birth, he was a normal child. He made eye contact, would respond to voices as any normal child does, however, after the two month vaccination, my child started staring off into space, and would not longer turn his head when hearing a voice, each of the seizures lasted approximately 10 to 20 seconds, with my son's eyes rolling back in his head, body non-responsive. Both incidences occurred at approximately 9:00 PM when I was putting him to sleep for the night. The 2 month vaccination was performed by Dr. of the clinic on 06-18-08. I did not report his to the Dr. because I was notified shortly after that she was no longer in business, so therefore I also do not have information on the manufacturer, lot #, route/site. The 4 mth vaccination was performed by the County Health District on 8/20/08. My child is developmentally delayed and diagnosed Autistic. He is permanently disabled and will never recover! It is so important as patient's parent to report this information. I suspect that vaccinations harm more people in the population that is currently being reports and therefore the statistics are inaccurate on the likelihood of a child being harmed. Parents should have this kind of information available so they can make better choices for their children, and understand how a few unfortunate souls are sacrificed for the common good of society. To put it rather bluntly, being one of those parents of a child harmed by vaccinations kind of sucks. Thank you for your time in allowing me to report this information on my son's behalf."

569356-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of multiple sclerosis in a unk subject who received Hepatitis B vaccine. On an unknown date, 90 days after receiving Hepatitis B vaccine, the subject developed multiple sclerosis. Serious criteria included GSK medically significant. The outcome of multiple sclerosis was unknown. It was unknown if the investigator considered the multiple sclerosis to be related to Hepatitis B vaccine. Additional information received: This case was reported in a literature article and it described the occurrence of multiple sclerosis in a subject of unknown age and gender who had been vaccinated with an unspecified hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer unknown). No information on the subject's medical history, concurrent medical conditions or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, from 1999 onwards, the subject received a dose of either ENGERIX B (GlaxoSmithKline; dosage, administration route and site unknown; batch number not provided) or RECOMBIVAX HB (Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp; dosage, administration route and site unknown; batch number not provided). On an unknown date after 1 January 2000, 90 days after receiving the vaccine, the subject developed new onset multiple sclerosis. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the events was unspecified at the time of reporting. The authors did not comment on any causal relationship between the vaccine and the events. The authors concluded that ""Findings from the present study show no long-term association of vaccines with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis and other central nervous system demyelinising diseases. In younger subjects, a short-term increase in risk after vaccination of any type was observed, which suggested that vaccines (like infections) could accelerate the transition from subclinical to overt autoimmunity in subjects with existing disease. The authors found no association between hepatitis B vaccination and an increased risk of multiple sclerosis or other central nervous system demyelinising diseases up to 3 years after vaccination. The results for human papillomavirus vaccine were inconclusive given the small number of cases and the paucity of previous studies on the topic. The findings reconciled the anecdotal clinical reports of a central nervous system demyelinising diseases onset shortly after vaccination with the larger body of epidemiologic literature showing no long-term increased risk of multiple sclerosis or other forms of central nervous system demyelinising diseases following vaccination. The findings do not warrant any change in vaccine policy"". This case is 1 of the 9 valid cases reported in the same literature article."

One hour, post vax, the pt reported pain and weakness of both arms. Two days later, the symptoms at the right arm subsided. The left arm remained painful in the upper part and numb in the lower part. It was generally weak, especially in the deltoid and the extensor muscle group. Symptoms subsided by 2/15/01, with the exception of some fingers dropping. Brachial plexus neuritis of left arm was dx'd. The pt was hospitalized (date unknown). Concomitant medication included TD vaccination on 12/26/00. Information on application of rabies-specific immunoglobulin was not provided. Preliminary assessment: Serious due to hospitalization. Causality, possible but questionable for plexus neuritis due to short interval.

179018-1,"It was reported that 24 French soldiers (among a unit of about 100 soldiers based in the Ivory Coast) presented, between mid-August and mid-September 2001, with food-borne infections. For 5 of them, the dx of Typhoid fever was confirmed on blood culture. For the others, the dx was not confirmed at the time of the report but they all presented with the same clinical signs. All the soldiers had been vaccinated within the 5 years preceding the onset of Typhoid fever. All pts were recovered at the time of the report (10/19/01) but duration of symptoms were not reported. After questioning of the soldiers, the suspect food was found to be a cucumber salad eaten on 8/14/01. Among the 45 persons exposed, 24 men developed Typhoid fever (among them 1 was vaccinated with Typherix, other mfr, the 23 others were vaccinated with Typhim VI). Only 5 blood cultures could be performed (because there was not enough material to perform them in all pts) and were positive for Salmonella Typhi. The other cases (with no blood culture performed), were considered as strongly probable cases of Typhoid fever because of the similar symptoms. The mean latency of onset of symptoms was 24 days. The mean temperature was 40.2C. All pts were hospitalized, treated with ofloxacin and recovered (duration not reported). Pt #15 was a 28 year old man, vaccinated with Typhoid vaccine on 9/8/99, 2 years before onset of symptoms. To be noticed that army recommendation is to re-vaccinate soldiers every 5 years (not consistent with French official recommendation: every 3 years). According to this data, an analysis was performed: the mean period between vaccination and date of onset of symptoms (9/01) was longer in infected pts than in non-infected pts. The risk was multiplied by 4.4 in the pts vaccinated since more than 3 years compared to pts vaccinated since less than 3 years. File to be completed.

Additional suspect vaccines included Hib-Titer vaccine, Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine, absorbed and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Products were administered on unspecified dates. Concomitant medications were not reported. In 2004, a literature article reported that a male child who is now 6 years old, developed meningitis at 5 years of age, caused by cephalosporin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, serotype 14. The patient demonstrated poor antibody responses to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccine, and a lack of antibody response to 23 valent non-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine. Combined vaccination with Prevnar and plain polysaccharide vaccines also failed to trigger an antibody response. His immunological work up was otherwise normal. The chld had remained clinically well following IV Ig substitution that resulted in protective titers of serum anti-pneumococcal antibodies. An immunological and genetic diagnoses of IRAK-4 deficiency was made, indicating that an impaired antibody response to carbohydrates may occur in IRAK-4 deficient children.

The child was hospitalised for 48 hours. There were 2 subsequent hospitalisations for inconsolable crying and one because of a hospitalisation of the mother due to pre-existing psychiatric problems. During severe crying the patient tends to have breath holding spells and it showed that the crying mostly occurred after feeding. The child also experienced loose stools in Dec-2005. After changing the food to Nutramigen this improved a lot. The patient has recovered. It seems that problems of the mother may have caused the child to be over-irritated, which was also shown by several visits to the ER in May-2007 (unrelated to the vaccinations) for vomiting, little drinking, crying, restless behaviour and slight fever. Body temperature (results: 39.1 deg. C.) was done on 30-Nov-2006. No additional information was available at the time of this report."

424085-1,"This case was reported by a physician and described the occurrence of exanthema in a 68-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with HAVRIX 1440 (GlaxoSmithKline). Concurrent medical conditions included polyarthrosis. On 25 January 2011 the subject received 1st dose of HAVRIX 1440 (intramuscular, unknown application site). On 28 February 2011, 34 days after vaccination with HAVRIX 1440, the subject developed exanthema and arthralgia. In February 2011 there was also weakness and in March 2011 laboratory abnormality. The subject was hospitalised for 9 days and treated with cortisone and analgesics. The vaccination course with HAVRIX 1440 was discontinued. The physician considered the events were probably related to vaccination with HAVRIX 1440. The subject was hospitalised from 27 April to 06 May 2011. According to the hospital report, the subject's medical history included polytrauma after traffic accident in 1981, total endoprosthesis of left hip, total knee endoprosthesis at both sides. Concurrent medical conditions included allergy to scents and coxarthrosis. The subject had reduced performance with rash on both arms and arthralgia since March 2011. This was in temporal relation to vaccination and an episode of diarrhea with fever, weight loss and increased C-reactive protein (CRP). The events improved after treatment with steroids. In summary, inflammatory rheumatoid disease could be excluded (normal immunology, no erosive changes). The subject was treated with prednisolone, Pantoprazol and diclofenac. Additionally monoclonal gammopathy IgG lambda was diagnosed. Immune fixation in urine showed no excretion of light chains. The subject had tremor and nervousness, which was considered to be a psychogenic reaction due to adjustment disorder. Arthralgia and exanthema were most likely a reaction to vaccination. Symptoms due to detected Chlamydia infection were considered unlikely, as this germ mainly causes urinary tract infections and HLA-B27 was negative. At the time of reporting exanthema was resolved. Arthralgia, weakness and laboratory abnormality were improved. The outcome of the other events was unspecified. No further information will be available."

430352-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of vasculitis cerebral in a 15-year-old subject of unspecified gender who was vaccinated with Hepatitis A vaccine (manufacturer unspecified) and meningococcal acwy vaccine (non-gsk). The subject's medical history included orbital trauma. Concurrent medical conditions included exercise induced asthma. On an unspecified date, the subject received an unspecified dose of Hepatitis A vaccine (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided) and an unspecified dose of Meningococcal ACWY vaccine (Non-GSK) (unknown). 10 days after vaccination with Hepatitis A vaccine and Meningococcal ACWY vaccine (Non-GSK), the subject experienced vasculitis cerebral (intracerebral vessel inflammation). This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event was unspecified. The author considered the event was unlikely to be related to vaccination with Hepatitis A vaccine and Meningococcal ACWY vaccine (Non-GSK). This case has been linked to case B0739797A : same literature article. Summary of the literature article: In 2004 the Clinical Consult Case Review (CCCR) working group was formed within the CDC-funded Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network to review individual cases of adverse events following immunizations (AEFI). Cases were referred by practitioners, health departments, or CDC employees. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) searches and literature reviews for similar cases were performed prior to review. After CCCR discussion, AEFI were assessed for a causal relationship with vaccination and recommendations regarding future immunizations were relayed back to the referring physicians. In 2010, surveys were sent to referring physicians to determine the utility and effectiveness of the CCCR service. CISA investigators reviewed 76 cases during 68 conference calls between April 2004 and December 2009. Almost half of the cases (35/76) were neurological in nature. Similar AEFI for the specific vaccines received were discovered for 63 cases through VAERS searches and for 38 cases through PubMed searches. Causality assessment using the probably related, 16 as possibly related, 18 as unlikely related, 10 as unrelated, and 17 had insufficient information to assign causality. The physician satisfaction survey was returned by 30 (57.7%) of those surveyed and a majority of respondents (93.3%) felt that the CCCR service was useful. The author's conclusion stated that the CCCR provides advice about AEFI to practitioners, assigns potential causality, and contributes to an improved understanding of adverse health events following immunizations."

He reported that it was shortly after AVA # 3 the he began to notice small patches of pruritic blisters that started on his hands, then on other areas of his body to include arms, feet and thighs. He denied any prior hx of skin issues. The lesion would appear intermittently, last a couple of wks and then resolve. He reported that they do not always reoccur in the same places and has no known precipitated factors. He has multiple visits to include an allergy consult in Aug 2001 and was assessed as having a contact dermatitis. Due to problems controlling his symptoms with various creams and a round of steroids he underwent a civilian dermatology evaluation in Jun 2004. He had skin testing for trees, grasses, molds, and animals. Testing noted strong positives to the majority of trees, grasses and weeds, with neg results to molds and animals. He was assessed as having a chronic urticarial/vesicular dermatitis of undetermined etiology, and an autoimmune process was ruled out. He continued to have reoccurrences of rash without relief from antihistamines and topical steroids. In Jan 07 he was evaluated by a military dermatologist and underwent a skin biopsy which revealed spongiotic dermatitis with focal overlying parakeratosis. He was assessed and treated for atopic eczematous dermatitis. Despite treatment with creams and moisturizers, he continues to have problems with his skin."
446608-1,"Information has been received from a nurse practitioner concerning a 23 year old female with drug allergy to amoxicillin, prednisone, CEFTIN, BIAXIN and no pertinent medical history who on 18-NOV-2011 was vaccinated with the first dose of GARDASIL, intramuscularly (dose not reported) (lot number 669794/1285AA). On 22-NOV-2011 the patient developed fever (103 F), cough, body aches, neck pain and nausea after the first dose of GARDASIL was given. The patient sought medical attention by office visit to the nurse practitioner. There was no treatment for the event. No laboratories were performed. At the time of the report the patient had not recovered. Follow-up information has been received from a nurse practitioner who reported that the female patient with no illness at time of vaccination, allergy to amoxicillin, prednisone, CEFTIN, BIAXIN, CECLOR and a medical history of pneumonia as an infant was vaccinated with the first dose of GARDASIL, (dose not reported) (lot number 669794/1285AA) Right Arm at 14:35. The nurse reported that on 22-NOV-2011, the patient experienced neck pain, body temperature measurement of 103 degrees F, headache, cough, starting 24 hours after receiving GARDASIL dose. The nurse mentioned that the patient was on an emergency room and was exposed to meningitis in the past month, subsequently the patient was diagnosed with meningitis and pneumonia and also required hospitalization per 6 days. A diagnostic laboratory test was performed which resulted in meningitis. On unknown day of December 2011 the patient recovered of meningitis and pneumonia. The reporter felt that meningitis and pneumonia were not related to GARDASIL. Additional information is expected."
448239-1,"This case was reported by a physician, via a sales representative, and described the occurrence of pertussis in a 9-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with BOOSTRIX (GlaxoSmithKline). On an unspecified date the subject received dose of BOOSTRIX (unknown route and injection site). It was not known whether basic immunization was completed or not. At an unspecified time after vaccination with BOOSTRIX, the subject experienced pertussis (vaccination failure). Pertussis was detected via serology of a blood sample. Throat swab was performed but the result was outstanding at the time of reporting. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. At the time of reporting the outcome of the events was unspecified. For another case regarding the same vaccine and the same event see case D0073635A. Follow up information was received on 09 December 2011. Basic immunization was completed as infant (4 vaccinations with unspecified vaccine). There were no concomitant medications, no concurrent medical conditions or any other risk factors. On 28 April 2009 the subject received booster dose of BOOSTRIX (intramuscular, left deltoid). On 23 November 2011, 30 months after vaccination with BOOSTRIX, the subject experienced pertussis (vaccination failure). The subject was treated with KLACID FORTE. At the time of reporting the outcome of the events was unspecified. The physician considered the events were possibly related to vaccination with BOOSTRIX. Follow up information was received on 23 January 2012 via regulatory authority. The case was identified as duplicate of case D0073735A which was voided. Initial information of duplicate case (received on 09 December 2011): This case was reported by a regulatory authority (DE-PEI-PEI2011039880) and described the occurrence of bronchial pneumonia in a 9-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with BOOSTRIX (GlaxoSmithKline). The subject received complete basic immunisation as an infant in 2002 and 2003. On 28 April 2009 the subject received booster dose of BOOSTRIX (intramuscular, left deltoid). On 21 November 2011, 3 years after vaccination with BOOSTRIX, the subject experienced bronchial pneumonia. Pertussis serology (IgA and IgG) were positive, as well as Chlamydia serology (IgA and IgG). This was considered to be a vaccination failure. The subject was hospitalised. At the time of reporting the outcome of the events was unspecified. Follow up information was received on 23 January 2012 via regulatory authority: The subject completely returned to health. The subject was not hospitalized.

This report refers to a 20-year-old female patient. The patient's medical history included tobacco use, appendectomy and amygdalectomy. Vaccination history included Measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in 2001 (without any allergic event), ENGERIX B vaccine in 2001, GARDASIL vaccine in 2007 and DTP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine in 2009. The manufacturer and batch number of these vaccines were not reported. Her concomitant medications included VARNOLINE as contraceptive drug. On the afternoon of 13 Aug 2012, she was vaccinated with MENVEO (batch number: M11027, expiration date: Aug 2013). On 14 Aug 2012, at noon, she experienced cutaneo-articular edema with purpuric petechial eruption on the internal side of the ankles and one phlyctena on the right Achilles' tendon. Her ankles and knees were swollen and stiff; she also experienced difficulty walking with morning stiffness for about 1 hour. She had bilateral ankle arthritis. She was hospitalized on an unknown date. No liquid was found in the joints and pleuropulmonary auscultation was normal. She probably experienced febricula during the night but no hyperthermia was noted during the hospitalization. Lung X-ray was normal. Hemoglobin was 114 g/L, platelets were 187000, leukocytes were 5460, neutrophils were 3096 and CRP was 18 mg/L expressing mild inflammatory syndrome. Sedimentation was normal at 11 mm after 1 hour. Blood culture report was pending at the time of this report. Screen for legionnella and pneumococcus antigen and capsid was negative in the urine. She was scheduled to be discharged on 16 Aug 2012. Causality assessment was not reported. The final outcome was reported as complete recovery. No other information was reported."
466490-1,"This retrospective pregnancy case was reported by a regulatory authority (# DE-BFARM-12229270) and described the occurrence of gastroschisis in a foetus female subject exposed to Seasonal Influenza vaccine (manufacturer unspecified), transplacentally when her 27-year-old mother was vaccinated. The neonate fetus was also exposed to co-suspect lamotrigine and concurrent HUMALOG insulin, FOLSAN and NOVORAPID. This was the mother's first pregnancy (BMI 23, no smoking, no alcohol, no illicit drugs, family history unknown). Pregnancy was complicated by the mother's periodontitis. The mother's last menstrual period was on 09 July 2011. The mother took lamotrigine 400 mg/d (200-0-200) because of epilepsy and insulin (via pump) because of type I diabetes mellitus (HbA1c not known) throughout pregnancy. On an unspecified date during pregnancy the subject's mother received unspecified dose of Seasonal Influenza vaccine. In gestational week 13 fetal gastroschisis was diagnosed in prenatal ultrasound. In gestational week 36+4 a baby girl was born via caesarian section with a birth weight of 2400g (>90. percentile), a length of 50cm, a head circumference of 33cm, an APGAR score of 8/9/9 and an umbilical pH of 7.26. The gastroschisis was confirmed and operated immediately after birth. In echocardiography on 21 March 2012 an atrial septal defect was noticed. Additionally, the girl had a small hemangioma on her right upper leg. The subject was hospitalised for 3 weeks and the events were a congenital anomaly. The baby showed no other anomalies and was discharged from hospital when she was three weeks old. The physician considered that the events were possibly related to lamotrigine. Relation to vaccination with Seasonal Influenza vaccine was reported to be unassessable. The physician stated that gastroschisis, hemangioma or atrial septal defects have not been reported as a specific pattern of lamotrigine exposure during pregnancy. However causality in this case cannot be excluded, as exposure took place during the sensitive periods of organ development. The physician reported that on the other hand, the mother suffered from diabetes type I and it was not known how well controlled this was during pregnancy. Depending on the level of HBA1c maternal diabetes increases the risk of malformations. Therefore, there also might be a correlation between gastroschisis and not well controlled diabetes. Insulin and folic acid use during pregnancy are well documented and no relation to the events was suspected. No further information will be available."
470890-1,"This case was reported by a physician via a regulatory authority (# DE-PEI-PEI2012052261) and described the occurrence of death - at present cause unknown - in an 80-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with INFLUSPLIT SSW (GlaxoSmithKline). Concurrent medical conditions included arterial hypertension, chronic gastritis, diabetes mellitus type 2, severe coronary arteriosclerosis and generalized arteriosclerosis. It was unknown whether or not previous vaccinations with vaccines not further specified, including or not INFLUSPLIT SSW (GlaxoSmithKline), have been well tolerated. On 10 October 2012 the subject received a dose of INFLUSPLIT SSW (0.5 ml, subcutaneous, unknown). Approximately one day post vaccination with INFLUSPLIT SSW, on 11 October 2012, the subject experienced blood pressure fluctuation and respiratory distress. In the night between 11 October 2012 and 11 October 2012 the subject died (death - at present cause unknown). The subject was found dead at home sitting in an arm chair by the daughter in law. An autopsy was performed. Additional information was received by the foreign regulatory authority by phone from the reporting physician on 16 October 2012, 17 October 2012 and 18 October 2012. An autopsy was performed on 17 October 2012. Despite autopsy the cause of death remained unknown. The autopsy showed a pulmonary edema, signs of congestion of liver, thrombi in the left cardiac atrium, a generalized arteriosclerosis with high-grade stenosis of the coronary arteries and with high-grade stenosis of internal carotid artery on both sides. Examination of the brain and several histological examinations are planned, but not yet conducted. Therefore the final autopsy result was not yet available. Initially the physician had reported that the subject has experienced worsening of general condition post vaccination with INFLUSPLIT SSW. Later on worsening of general condition was specified and the physician more precisely reported that the subject experienced blood pressure fluctuation and respiratory distress. In additional information was received by the regulatory authority by phone on 18 October 2012 from a general practitioner, the family physician of the subject. This physician has specified that the seasonal trivalent Influenza vaccine used for vaccination on 10 October 2012 had been INFLUSPLIT SSW (GlaxoSmithKline). The foreign regulatory authority has requested further information. At the moment no further information was available."

483320-1,"Just thought I'd pass along this info to you about symptoms following getting the flu shot. I know it's been quite awhile, now, but I wasn't interested in paying to get a bunch of tests done, and hoped the symptoms would just clear up. About a half hour after receiving the vaccine, I was in the grocery store, thinking about what I was looking at, and suddenly experienced a very strange feeling in my head that I never felt before, and right after that felt like I was about to pass out. I never felt like that before, either. I grabbed onto something, and waited, and the symptoms mostly left up. Since then, at unexpected times, I have short periods of dizzy lightheadedness. Also, later the same day, I started with a lot of headache and neck stiffness, and in the following days, was tired, weak, and aching. My usual mild sinus symptoms got much worse. Most concerning was the recurrence of symptoms I had as a teenager, (after an mva, with head and neck injuries) mainly irritation and pressure at the base of the skull, and the right eye feeling strained and pulled upward. This was quite disturbing. I know that people who push for getting the flu shot say it's just a coincidence that people get sick following it. But I fully believe that my experience was a direct result of the vaccine. So now, even with the flu epidemic upon us, I see getting the flu shot to be a greater risk than not getting it. I'm told that the vaccine is only effective for a small percentage of the types of flu, anyway. Patient in office to fill out VAERS form re: flu shot. Alerted us to the fact that she missed work 1/16 and 1/17/13 due to sweats, headache, chills. She did not feel better until 1/23/13 and is not sure if it is related to all the other symptoms she has had since November."
501600-1,"Case was received from a healthcare professional on 26-Aug-2013 and additional information on 28-Aug-2013. Case is medically confirmed. This case is part of a cluster of two cases (same reporter, same product, same lot-no., different patient, different reaction). Case is linked with not serious case E2013-06370. A male infant received the second dose of rotavirus live vaccine (manufacturer, lot number not reported) on an unspecified date in 2013. Unspecified time later at the age of 11 weeks, he received the first dose of HEXYON (lot-no. J0553-1) IM into the right thigh on 25-Jul-2013. On the same day the patient was vaccinated with the first dose of PREVENAR (Pfizer, lot-no. not reported) into left thigh. Six day later, on 31-Jul-2013 at the age of 12 weeks, the patient developed petechiae on both lower legs. On an unspecified date a streptococcus A quick test, performed by the paediatrician, was negative. On 05-Aug-2013 the patient was hospitalised due to temporary livid colouring of the right leg, which was also observed on the left leg one week before. After changing the child position the discolouration rapidly disappeared with an anamnestic capillary refill time less than 2 seconds. Physical investigation in the hospital showed petechiae at both lower legs (right more than left0 and capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. Body temperature was 36.9 degrees C. For laboratory results of 5- and 7-Aug-2013, see lab comments. On 06-Aug-2013 coagulation examinations showed slight increased coagulation and fibrinolytic activity (increased D-Dimer). A von Willebrand's factor deficit could be excluded. On 07-Aug-2013 thrombocyte testing showed normal results. Platelet function test was normal. On 05-Aug-2013 stool sample was negative for entire range of enteritis viruses. On 05-Aug-2013 urine test was normal. On 06-Aug-2013 sonography of brain could exclude an intracerebral bleeding and stasis of CSF. The same day abdominal sonography showed no pathologies. On 07-Aug-2013 dermatologist of the hospital could not establish a final diagnosis. According to the dermatologist due to anamnesis and residual symptoms for example Schonlein-Henoch purpura after vaccination (with differential diagnosis of acute haemorrhagic oedema in childhood) could be considered, but this diagnosis was not reported in the final diagnosis of the discharge letter. Finally diagnosis of petechiae due to vaccination or an unnoticed infection was established. On 07-Aug-2013 the patient was discharged from hospital, completely recovered. According to the reporter, the reaction was possibly related to HEXYON. The patient's paternal grandmother suffered from bleeding tendency. Previously the patient received the first dose of rotavirus live vaccine (manufacturer not reported) on an unspecified date in 2013. Toleration was not reported. Upon medical review the company judged relevant to code the second dose of rotavirus vaccine as a suspect drug, because considering the infant's age at vaccination of HEXYON and PREVENAR this was potentially given in a close timeframe."

Case received from the Health Authorities on 04-Mar-2014 under the reference number NC20140188. An 18-year-old female patient received the third injection of GARDASIL (batch number not reported) (dose and route unknown) on 12-Jan-2009. She had previously received 2 doses of the vaccine on 11-Jul-2008 and 12-Sep-2008. The patient had no personal or family relevant medical history except notion of a bronchitis in December 2008. In February 2009, she developed a very severe subacute sensimotor polyradiculoneuritis leading to tetraplegia with major motor deficit within 6 months. Her condition required various prolonged hospitalisations in different hospitals and reeducation centers. The patient was treated with sequential transfusions of intravenous immunoglobulins followed by plasmapheresis and long-term corticotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy. She started to recover at the end of 2009 and made continuous progresses until the end of 2012, when her neurological condition seemed to stabilise at a sequelae stage: with tetraparesis and proprioceptive ataxia, walk aided with splints to prevent steppage gait. At the time of the report, the patient was still under immunosuppressive therapy with IMUREL and intravenous immunoglobulins, in the course of discontinuation. Upon medical review the company considered relevant to code hospitalisation as seriousness criterion that was mentioned in the narrative by the Health Authorities but not coded. The Health Authorities assessed the causal relationship between the reported reactions and GARDASIL vaccination as doubtful according to the foreign method of assessment. The Health Authorities specified that ""causality was assessed without being detrimental to the findings of any investigations which might be performed in the context of legal or out-of-court procedures for compensation""."
610278-1,"This health authority report (initial receipt 04-Nov-2015) concerns a  55 year-old male patient who had underlying conditions of coronary heart disease and renal insufficiency. The patient had not been administered with Afluria and Pneumovax 23 on the previous occasions. On 26-Oct-2015, the patient received Afluria 2015/2016 injection (Influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, batch number 0986-29701) for via the subcutaneous route on the left upper arm for prophylactic vaccination. On the same day, the patient also received Pneumovax 23 (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, batch number K010280) via the subcutaneous route on the right upper arm for prophylactic vaccination. On 27-Oct-2015, the patient developed fever, headache, pain in limb, feeling sick, infection, swelling arm and sepsis, which lasted for 3 days. The first day after the injection, the patient's temperature was around 40 degrees and 38.5 degrees on the fourth day. The patient had severe feeling of sickness. The patient showed other medically important condition. The diagnosis was confirmed with body temperature (result: 40 degrees Celcius), procalcitonin (result: 1,73 ng/ml), blood sedimentation increased (result: 84 mm per hour). The diagnosis was also confirmed by the following lab tests: 28-Oct-2015: lymphocyte count low (result: 4.3%), neutrophil count increased (result: 86.4%), GFR (glomerular filtration rate) decreased (result: 37 ml/min), blood creatinine increased (result: 1.98 mg/dl), white blood cell increased (result: 29.2 Tsd/l), and C-reactive protein (result: 153 mg/l). 03-Nov-2015: C-reactive protein increased (result: 28.4 mg/l), lymphocyte count normal (result: 25%), blood neutrophils normal (result: 57%), gamma-GT increased (result: 107 U/l), GFR decreased (result: 45ml/min), Blood creatinine increased (result: 1.68 mg/dl), and leukocyte count increased (result: 13.3 Tsd/l). The patient was treated with an antibiotic therapy. The outcome not recovered at the time of reporting. Reporter's Comments: Reporter comments: The regulatory assessed the case as serious (medically significant). The reporter assessed the causality as probably/likely in relation to Afluria and Pneumovax, reported that the adverse drug reaction did not result in hospitalisation, and reported  'suspected bacterial contamination of ampoules'. Sender's Comments: Company comments: Seriousness criterion/criteria: Medically significant. Listedness: Unlisted. Assessment according to the CCDS for CSL Inactivated Influenza Virus and the Afluria PI, sepsis and all other events are unlisted except headache and feeling unwell which are listed. Causality: Possible. Time to onset is next day of vaccination. Patient had history of coronary heart disease and renal insufficiency (cause unspecified). Cellulitis and cellulitis like reaction are known adverse events of CSL IVV and Pneumovax respectively. Pneumovax and Influenza vaccine were administered in opposite arms, however it was not specified whether Influenza or the Pneumovax vaccinated arm was the site/source of sepsis. Fever and investigation support infection (inflammatory markers, procalcitonin, WCC, neutrophils raised). Causality for sepsis and related events is considered possible in relation to both vaccines. Renal impairment (GFR decreased, Blood creatinine increase) may represent baseline values or worsening as a result of sepsis. Similarly raised gamma-GT suggests liver disease and or underlying excess alcohol use, therefore causality for these events is unassessable as baseline value was not provided. Causality for bacterial contamination of vaccine (ampoules) as a source of sepsis is considered unassessable; manufacturing process ensures that vaccine is sterile; however a sterility investigation is required to exclude influenza vaccine as a source of infection. Concomitant administration of both vaccines can cause systemic inflammation. However the events and results of investigations support bacterial infection, therefore bac"

This report refers to a 33 year old female patient. The physician reported that since years the patient did not present familiar anamnesis and personal anamnesis until 2010, histories of lung diseases, lymphatic diseases and/or autoimmune diseases. The patient was working as a care giver to an old man. The patient was vaccinated with FLUAD (batch number: not reported) on 28 Oct 2010 in autumn. In winter the patient had experienced three to four episodes of acute, recurrent infections of the respiratory ways. The patient decided then not to undergo vaccination any longer. Three years ago (on an unspecified date), the patient underwent appendectomy and she had some episodes of lumbalgia (probable cause was the obesity) and scapula-humeral periarthritis. One and half year ago (on an unspecified date), the patient presented with uveitis subsequent to both eyes (this disease could be related to the administration of squalene contained in FLUAD). On 28 Apr 2015, the patient experienced demyelination and sarcoidosis. The patient arrived this winter with algoneurodystrophy at the upper arm on the right side. The magnetic resonance (MR) of the cervical spine evidenced a lesion of the spinal cord with hyperintensity of the signal postero-medial from C2 to C3 with enhancement post-contrast material predominantly posteriorly. The patient was admitted to the neurology department with the suspect of demyelinating disease; at the positron emission tomography (PET_ this lesion resulted not up taking the contrast material. On cephalorhachidian fluid examination showed an evidence of presence of albumin and the endoliquoral presence of rare big mononucleated cells. AB anti-neuron and AB anti-aquaporin have been performed, a CT scan of the chest showed an evidence of diffuse nodularity (a greater than 5 mm) mantellary-subpleural and central and thorax showed mantle sub-pleural nodules (abnormal), and a biopsy of the inguinal lymph nodes on the right side showed epithelioid histiocytes (abnormal), that evidenced at the histological examination, the presence of tissue of multiple granulomas not necrotizing constituted by epithelioid histiocytes. The patient was hospitalized. The patient was discharged with the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis with cervical spinal cord lesion. She was at present under maintenance corticosteroid therapy and up at the outpatient clinic for the second level of the sarcoidosis. Outcome of the events was condition unchanged. Events were assessed as serious (disability and hospitalization). Causality between the events and suspect vaccine FLUAD was assessed as intermediate according to WHO algorithm. Follow up report received from the HCP via Agency on 28 Jul 2015: updated treatment, laboratory tests and seriousness criteria (hospitalization). Following an internal review on 06 Aug 2015, a case correction was performed for the information received on 28 Jul 2015: added an event (inappropriate age at vaccine administration). Follow up received from physician via Agency on 10 Aug 2015: updated current condition (obesity), lab data (positron emission tomogram, histology and CSF test), new events (respiratory tract infection, intervertebral disc disorder, lumbalgia, granuloma, periarthritis, uveitis and algoneurodystrophy) and other clinically relevant information in the narrative.

A 72-year-old female elderly patient received pneumococcal polysaccharide (23 serotypes) vaccine (manufacturer unknown, batch number unknown) on an unknown date. Other suspect products included: -influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown, batch number unknown) on an unknown date. -Haemophilus type b polysaccharide vaccine (manufacturer unknown, batch number unknown) on an unknown date. -Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent (other manufacturer, batch number unknown) on an unknown date. The patient experienced acute respiratory infection and pneumonia on an unknown date. The patient was admitted to hospital on an unspecified date. The patient had a medical history of Rheumatoid arthritis. The patient had received Prednisone. According to the article: This patient was within a prospective study in a cohort of 294 patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, included in the vaccination program: seasonal flu vaccine (October to April), pneumococcal (combined regimen 13-valent and 23-valent) and Haemophilus influenzae B. Patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for infections, especially respiratory type. Immunization is a recommended measure to reduce these complications. Among all 294 patients, only 42 were not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy: 147 were treated with DMARD'S (Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs) and 98 were with TNFa inhibitor. The patient received biologic treatment before but not at the time of vaccination, regarding the ARI (acute respiratory infections), before inclusion in the vaccination program, 20 (7%) patients in the cohort studied had been admitted into the hospital for this reason. During follow-up and subsequent immunization, only 6 of the 287 patients (2.1%) had ARI, including this patient. The patient's outcome was reported as Unknown. Sender's Comments: Latency is unknown in this case, it is not possible to consider it a vaccination failure. Pneumococcal vaccine being inactivated, it cannot cause an infection. The patient had a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, her immune system is thus weakened. Exact latency and additional information on patient's immune status at the time of vaccination is necessary to assess the case."

On approx. 9/10/92, the pt developed inflammation around the injection site, had a fever and generally felt irritable and ""grisly"". These symptoms lasted a few days. Two weeks, post vax, the pt began continually rocking back and forth whilst in bed or sitting in his playpen. Approx. 4 weeks, post vax, he began to suffer from trances whereby he would stare into space for a few minutes and remain undistracted. Three months, post vax, on approx. 12/10/92, the pt developed a disturbed sleeping pattern and an intolerance to certain foods. He became hypersensitive to colorants and sugars and was placed on a gluten-free diet. The pt developed dark circles under his eyes and his complexion became very pale. Additionally, he began to experience severe bowel problems with intermittent bouts of diarrhea, constipation and extreme discomfort of defecation. The pt was subsequently referred to the hospital for exam and it was noted that he suffered from lymphoid hyperplasia. Also, at this time, the pt's speech development stopped along with his ability to socially interact and he developed a sensitivity to bright lights and began toe walking, which subsequently resolved. On 3/29/93, the pt was dx'd with global developmental delay, however, in 1996 both his school and a physician dx'd him as having ""autistic tendencies"" and it was noted that he suffered from autistic spectrum disorder. Upon internal review, autism and intestinal disorder were considered ""Other Important Medical Events"". The pt's allergy (intolerance to certain foods/sensitivity to colorants and sugars) was considered an incidental finding. No further information is available. F/U states, In 6/95, the pt had grommets fitted to both ears and his adenoids removed at the same time. It was successful in stopping his recurrent ear infections and in allowing him to breathe more easily through his nose, consequently, he was able to sleep better and not get such a dry throat. Since these events, his balance and walking had improved considerably. He also, seemed to understand things better ""indicating that previously his diminished hearing was a contributary factor"".

Upon internal review, atypical autism is considered to be an other important medical event. No further info is available. The follow up states that a legal claim form has been received as follow up info. Per the document, the pt, five to six hours after being vaccinated experienced a raised temp. The pt's mother took her temp with a forehead thermometer and it showed the temp to be 102 to 103 degrees C. The pt was grumpy and irritable. Calpol was administered and brought her temperature down. However, the pt continued to have a high temp on and off for three weeks. For the first 48 hours following the vaccination, the pt's stools were noted to be extremely loose and foul smelling. For the first three weeks, the pt's high temp and bowel problems went hand in hand. However, the pt's bowels continued to be erratic for some time after. Within two months of the vaccination the pt became aggressive towards her family. She would kick and shout and constantly scream. Within two months of one vaccination the pt's speech deteriorated to just screaming to get attention. Previously, she had started to string words together such as ""like doggie"" or ""want a drink."" By Christmas 1993, she had lost eye contact. She became unrespsonsive and would not respond when called. Within three months of having been vaccinated the pt's eating patterns changed dramatically. She would eat huge quantities of dairy products and bread. The pt continues to be a fussy eater and will only eat a few types of food. Her liquie intake also increased.

No current medical conditions and no concurrent medications were reported. On 10/28/02, the subject, a soldier of the German armed forces, received the second dose of hepatitis A and B vaccine, lot number HAB208H4. Concomitantly, tetanus-diphtheria vaccine was administered. One day post vaccination, on 10/29/02, the subject developed symptoms of a common cold, headache, nausea, and fever. At 3PM, the subject consulted the medical officer, was transferred to the bed unit and was symptomatically treated with paracetamol, cooling of the calf of the legs with compresses, metoclopramide hydrochloride and dipyrone. Fever decreased to 39.8C. At 6:30PM, body temperature was 40 C (axillary measured). Therefore, a cannula was inserted in the vein and Ringer's solution, sodium chloride solution and dipyrone were administered and the subject received paracetamol. Fever decreased to 38.4 C. At 10pm, fever was 38.5C and the subject was responsive, awake and oriented. The night from 10/29/02 to 10/30/2002 was uneventful.

An autopsy was announced. The public prosecutor will be involved."
193371-1,"June 21-24hrs pt screamed quite loudly when he received his immunizations and whimpered off and on afterward. The most immediate and noticeable change in pt was emotional and metabolic. He was unusually fussy and prone to crying and screaming. His normal stools were deep mustard in color and never runny. After the immunizations his stools were very loose, watery, a pale yellow color with a strong odor and the stools ran out the back of his diaper. He had frequent bowel movements like this throughout each day and they continued in this manner until he died. He was also noticeably sweaty with an oily smelling scalp, like someone who'd done a strenuous workout. This was not normal for pt. He would be bathed and this condition returned very quickly. Before his immunizations, pt enjoyed his baths. After his immunizations he would scream and cry the whole time he was bathed until he was dried off and clothed. The same would happen when he would be washed for a diaper change. He did not even enjoy being powdered anymore and this had been his favorite part of bathing. Mentally, I noticed at one point pt would stare directly in front of him as if in a trance. I would try to get his attention and he would not respond. After a short time pt would come out of this trance-like state and would growl. Pt seemed confused and upset when he came out of this trance-like state. I fully expected pt to be irritable for at least 72 hrs after his shots. Generally speaking this was my experience with my other 3 children after immunization. I also expected him to be very sleepy. To alleviate his discomfort, the Drs. advised the use of Tylenol drops. I medicated my other children in the same way with good success. With pt the Tylenol did not work. He was still very fussy and unhappy. I did not know what to think. But because my husband had cut teeth at 3 mos. of age I believe there was a possibility that pt was cutting teeth. I felt his gums and it was questionable but I thought there could be teeth under the gums. So I gave him teething medication. It seemed to help a little but not for long. He was back to fussing after a short time. I also noticed pt was unusually gassy and I thought this was due to the diarrhea. I thought this might be causing his fussiness. So I gave him gas drops. It seemed to help him pass some gas but it didn't help with the fussing. June 26 (five days)-We were also in the midst of a move so we also felt there was a change pt was upset because of the change. We had packed out our home and thought his fussiness might be because his things were packed away. While the movers were packing, I carried pt around in a carrier. He was fussy even then and I moved around quite a bit. He just continued not to be himself. June 27 (6 days)-Then when we moved to our temporary living facility, we thought perhaps the strangeness of the surroundings was upsetting pt. Pt's nature was such that he preferred being home in familiar surroundings, that's where he was happiest. The following thing were always helpful with pt in the past when he was fussy: nursing, rocking, swinging in his swing, sitting in his bouncy chair, being held, bathing him, and changing his diaper. Some of these thing helped a little after he was immunized but not for very long. Nursing was good until he'd eaten what he needed, then he'd be fussy, gassy and have diarrhea. Nothing we did really seemed to help keep pt content like he once was. Even pt's most favorite thing, being held, was of little consolation. At this point I was very concerned that we would not be able to keep pt calm long enough to make the plane trip across the ocean of the US. I was sure that people would become annoyed with us for having this very noisy baby. I thought to take pt to see the Dr. but I never took him in because I believed the Drs. would only tell me that I had a colicky child. We started putting pt in an adjoining room during meals because he was just constantly fussing, crying or screaming."
202218-1,"It was reported that a male adult was passively immunized with Imogram Rabies and 1 dose of Rabies imovax and dose 2 and 3 of Rabies Imovax administered on 3/6/03 and 3/10/03, respectively. Two years back the man was hospitalized after experiencing a swelling of the throat and an intense exanthema. He was examined for allergy, but no conclusive findings were done. On 3/3/03 the soldier was on a mission shooting wild dogs and got some blood from the dogs on an open wound on hands and forearm. Since he was no0t previously immunized against rabies, a post-exposure regimen was started. On 3/12/03 the man developed urticaria over major parts of the body, fever 39.6C and complained over swelling of throat. He was treated with Polaramin 2mg times 3 during the day. It was however decided to transport the man to the field hospital and before the trip he was given SoluCortef 250mg IV. During the transport, the man got sweaty, pale, and tachycard, and was given adrenalin 0.2mg IV. Since 3/16/03 the man is stable, with no other symptoms than a cough and a runny nose consistent with a light viral infection. The event was looked upon as a reaction to Imogam Rabies or Rabies-Imovax and one has postponed further vaccination of the man. The case is closed. The HC professional assessment: Since the described reaction occurred 9 days after the administration of Imogam Rabies, it is somehow likely that the reaction was due to the humane immunoglobulin. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that the reaction was due to the vaccination, since the event is reported after administration of the vaccine. FU 8/SEPT/2004: Another Health authority reference has been reported NOMAADVRE2003-41. On 12MAR2003 the patient had blood pressure 125/60 (no unit reported) and pulse 96 (no unit reported).

The authors performed a retrospective, descriptive study of all reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths in 2007/2008 season. This child was recommended for vaccination by 2007/2008 ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) criteria. This child was vaccinated with INFLUENZA (manufacturer unknown, batch number: unknown) during 2007/2008 season. The patient was partially vaccinated and did not complete vaccination schedule. The child presented with influenza which later lead to death on unknown date. The causality was not reported. The authors commented that influenza-associated mortality among children is a rare event; however, healthcare providers should be mindful of the severe outcomes associated with influenza in children, especially those with high-risk medical condition. Critically ill children should be promptly treated with anti-viral medications, unless contraindicated, upon influenza diagnosis or suspicion. Because isolation of S. aureus potentially representing co-infection was identified in a substantial proportion (19%) of children with influenza-associated mortality within three days of hospital admission, healthcare providers should consider administering antimicrobial agents active against locally circulating strains of S. aureus when empirically treating children with influenza-like illness and severe respiratory illness."

Concomitant therapy included oral contraceptives (unspecified). The R.N reported that after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, on 15-JAN-2011 the patient experienced a severe topical allergic reaction. The patient broke out in a severe rash. The rash was red, bumpy, itchy and irritated. The rash covered the patient's hand, arm and legs. She had some rash on her forehead. The patient used some hydrocortisone cream on the rash. The R.N stated that the patient had never had an allergy to yeast and had not had any issues with vaccines in the past. There were no laboratory test performed. On 17-JAN-2010, when the patients contacted the physician's office she was improving. The patient sought unspecified medical attention. Follow up information has been received from the registered nurse indicating that on 14-JAN-2011 at 16:00 the IT recruiting patient was vaccinated intramuscularly in the right deltoid. On 15-JAN-2011 the patient broke out in red, bumpy, itchy, irritated rash. The patient used hydrocortisone cream and rash started to improve on 17-JAN-2011. The patient recovered on 17-JAN-2011.

446451-1,"This case was reported by a physician and described the occurrence of Parsonage-Turner syndrome in a 48-year-old male subject who was vaccinated with FLUARIX 2011-12 season (GlaxoSmithKline). In October 2011, the subject received unspecified dose of FLUARIX 2011-12 season (unknown route, left arm). In 2011, at an unspecified time after vaccination with FLUARIX 2011-12 season, the subject experienced Parsonage-Turner syndrome associated with decreased strength in the vaccinated arm, injection site parasthesia, hyporeflexia and injection site pain. An electromyogram was performed end of November 2011 and revealed a light abnormality in the left arm. At the time of reporting the events were improved. This case was linked to case B0768620A as it was reported by the same reporter. Follow-up information received on 9 December 2011: The subject had no relevant medical history and didn't take chronic medication. In 2011, within the month (quickly after) of vaccination with FLUARIX 2011-12 season, the subject experienced injection arm pain, light injection site paraesthesia in the left arm with a circular pattern till the thumb and index finger and sensory changes. When these zones were touched, it was less sharply felt than contralateral. The strength was not seriously affected but seemed to be reduced. When the subject held heavy objects, he experienced more difficulties with the vaccinated arm than with the other. The pain could sometimes be so heavy that he could not sleep at night. The subject didn't experience headache or neck pain, there was no radiation feeling from the neck or shoulder downwards. The subject was treated with Paracetamol 1000mg which improved the pain. The results of the clinical neurological examination were: a conscious adequate and well oriented man, without the results of the clinical neurological examination were: a conscious adequate and well oriented man, without meningeal tingling signs, normal cranial nerves, clear hypoesthesia of the upper limbs that seemed to match more or less with the C5 and C6 dermatome, no pain on palpitation of the plexus loge, no atrophy, no fasciculation, light decreased grip power with the left hand, biceps and brachioradialis tendon reflexes clearly less well aroused left compared to right, no Hoffman-Tromner's signs, normal course and state, no other abnormalities. The electromyogram revealed a bilateral extended distal motor latency over medianus to abductor pollicis brevis, normal values over ulnaris to abductor digiti minimi, normal compound muscle action potential amplitudes, normal F-waves and normal conduction speeds. There were no conduction blocks. There was a normal stimulation from the plexus itself. The myography of abductor digitis minimi, the first dorsal interosseous, the extensor carpi radialis, the biceps and the bilateral deltoid did not show acute signs of denervation, but the biceps myography was somewhat denerved left during contraction. This could be compatible with limited plexitis or C5-C6 problem seen and the slight chronic denervations in the biceps. No abnormalities were noticed on the neuropathy (no acute denervations). The diagnosis was a kind of Parsonage-Turner-like image in view of the combination of objective sensory changes, hyporeflexia and slight deviations on myography in the left arm. The physician considered the events were unrelated to vaccination with FLUARIX 2011-12 season. The cause of the events could be an indirect inflammatory reaction to the injection or could have a cervical origin (surely very unlikely seen the history and the time course of the symptoms). The physician suggested to adopt a wait-and-see attitude for the next four weeks and to associate only Befact forte 2 times a day. If after one month the symptoms still persist or expand, additional research should be scheduled and a treatment with steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin's could be considered.

486352-1,"Case retrieved from the literature on 22 February 2013. A total of 22 cases were created corresponding to the cases classified as possible Yellow Fever (YF) vaccine reactions. This case is linked with the reference case 2013-03410. Abstract: ""BACKGROUND Serious, but rare adverse events following immunization (AEFI) have been reported with yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine, including severe allergic reactions, FY vaccine-associated neurologic disease (YEL-AND) and YF-vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). The frequency with which YEL-AND and YEL-AVD occur in YF endemic countries is mostly unknown. METHOD: From 2007 to 2010, eight countries - implemented large-scale YF preventive vaccination campaigns. Each country established vaccine pharmacovigilance systems that included standard case definitions, procedures to collect and transport biological specimens, and National Expert Committees to review data and classify cases. Staff in all countries received training and laboratory capacity expanded. RESULTS: In total, just over 38 million people were vaccinated against YF and 3116 AEFIs were reported of which 164 (5%) were classified as serious. Of these, 22 (13%) were classified as YF vaccine reactions, including 11 (50%) hypersensitivity reactions, six (27%) suspected YEL-AND, and five (23%) suspected YEL-AVD. The incidence per 100,000 vaccine doses administered was 8.2 for all reported AEFIs, 0.43 for any serious AEFI, 0.058 for YF vaccine related AEFIs, 0.029 for hypersensitivity reactions, 0.016 for YELAND, and 0.013 for YEL-AVD. Our findings were limited by operational challenges, including difficulties in obtaining recommended biological specimens leading to incomplete laboratory evaluation, unknown case ascertainment, and variable levels of staff training and experience. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations, active case-finding in the eight different countries did not find an incidence of YF vaccine associated AEFI's that was higher than previous assistant. These data reinforce the safety profile of YF vaccine and support the continued use of attenuated FY vaccine during preventive mass vaccination campaigns in YF endemic areas."" Study design and setting: ""From 2007 to 2010, active surveillance of serious AEFIs was undertaken during preventive YF vaccination campaigns. All countries were included in the analysis due to unavailability of the national database. Both the 17D-204 and 17DD YF substrain vaccines were 73 used."" The present case described a 28-year-old male patient, with no reported medical history and concomitant therapy, who had received a dose of Yellow fever vaccine (manufacturer unknown, batch number, route and site of administration not reported) on an unspecified date.

Reference range and units were not provided for diagnostics. Outcome was unknown at time of reporting. The investigator considered that there was no reasonable possibility that the bronchitis, acute on chronic renal failure, hepatitis and hyperkalemia may have been caused by belimumab, Pneumococcal vaccine and tetanus vaccine. Follow-up received on 11 January 2013: The bronchitis resolved on an unknown date. The acute on chronic renal failure had not resolved. Hepatitis improved and hyperkalemia resolved on 10 January 2013. 08 January 2013- Renal biopsy was done. Hydroxychloroquine was on hold due to transaminitis.

On 8/18/13 she noted generalized malaise and sniffles. She denied local site reaction symptoms (erythema, swelling, lymphadenopathy). On 8/19/13 when she woke and sat up she noted ""soreness"" (rated as a 3/10) across her upper sternum which increased slightly with deep breaths and palpation; she continued with her normal routine (she thought that the discomfort/""soreness"" was from sleeping on her stomach). While at work at 0815 she noted an increase in the soreness to a 6 which lasted about 5 minutes. She felt ""hot and weak"" and the pain increased with deep breaths. When she was triaged in the ER at 0922 her discomfort was a 4/5. She had a negative Troponin (0.012ng/ml), normal CXR, and an EKG which showed NSR with no ST elevation. She took 800mg MOTRIN at 1600 and when she woke from a nap her pain was a 1/10. On 8/20/13 she still had the sniffles and she had a headache (frontal and temples; 2/10; described as annoying which she attributed to a lack of sleep) and ""chest"" discomfort (1/10) upper 1/4th of the sternum which increased slightly with deep breath and palpation. The patient denied a hx of GERD, reflux, or recent indigestion. She reported that the staff in the Immunization Clinic had started ""circuit workouts"" the previous week. She denied palpitations and the discomfort was non-positional. The lateral aspect of the upper sternum was tender to palpation. She was instructed to take 800mg of MOTRIN tid with food and was given a no PT chit until her follow-up apt on 8/29/13. On 8/29/13 she reported that she experienced 1/10 chest soreness which increased with deep breaths, palpation to her upper sternal borders and lying on her stomach until 8/23/13 at which time her previous symptoms (headache, chest soreness, malaise) resolved. The patient stopped taking the MOTRIN on 8/23/13. The patient states that her ""sniffles"" have almost resolved. The patient did note a small amount of erythema (1cm) around the vaccination site and mild axillary lymph node tenderness which started on 8/22/13. There was no tenderness noted to the upper sternal border when palpated. It is the consensus of VHC expert opinion that the patient's condition does not meet the case definition of pericarditis or myocarditis but was non-cardiac in nature possibly related to costochondritis-- possibly an inflammatory response from the SPV or the patient's recent expanded exercise regimen."

On 25-APR-2013, at 8:00 am, the patient developed dressed state or autonomic nervous system inbalance. Headache, slight fever, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness and general malaise were also observed as well as queasy and inappetence. When the patient went to school, she got tired and had to stay in bed for a while. In addition, transient numbness in hands and feet was observed. On an unspecified date, a blood test, head computer tomography (CT) and gastroscopy showed no abnormality. On 02-NOV-2013, the patient was recovering from depressed state, autonomic nervous system imbalance and numbness in hands and feet. Reporter's comment: The symptoms were considered to be adverse reactions to GARDASIL. The reporting physician considered depressed state, autonomic nervous system imbalance and numbness in hands and feet as serious due to disability. The reporting physician felt that depressed state, autonomic nervous system imbalance and numbness in hands and feet were related to GARDASIL, and there were no other causes of depressed state and autonomic nervous system imbalance. Information has been received for a direct report from the PMDA regarding a case provided by the physician. Additional information has been requested."
515637-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of active hepatitis in a 37-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with Hepatitis B vaccine (manufacturer unspecified). The subject was a health professional, but there were no recognized occupational exposures to HBV and no other risk factors for hepatitis identified. The subject's mother was known to have chronic hepatitis B. The subject did not receive immunoprophylaxis when she was born. On an unspecified date, the subject received primary course and booster dose of Hepatitis B vaccine (unknown route, site of injection and batch number). On an unspecified date, the subject was vaccinated with a primary course of Hepatitis B vaccine (unknown route, site of injection and batch number) as a teenager and received booster vaccines (unknown route, site of injection and batch number) with anti-HBs levels > 100 IU/mL in 1994. In 1991 and in 2003 HBsAg testing was negative. At an unspecified time after vaccination with Hepatitis B vaccine, the subject presented negative standard HBsAg immunoassay despite persistent viraemia and active hepatitis. The subject also experienced abnormal liver function following a needle-stick injury. Further testing at presentation showed negative serum HBsAg, but serum was positive for antibodies directed against the core protein of HBV (anti-HBc). The hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg) was also detected and the HBV DNA level was 134,488 IU/mL. Six months later, HBV DNA levels remained detectable and serum HBsAg remained negative. Sequencing of the HBV genome was performed and identified a four amino acid (aa) insertion in the surface protein. Genetic variation in this region has previously been associated with diagnostic escape; the region is adjacent to the major antigenic determinant of HBsAg. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. The subject was treated with pegylated interferon weekly and serum HBV DNA declined through the time. Regarding this case, routine testing for HBV infection should always include serology for HBsAg and anti-HBs, as well as anti-HBc. In the setting of a high index of clinical suspicion, further testing should include PCR testing for HBV DNA, as well as HBeAg and anti-HBe serology."

The patient denied any systemic symptoms and had no family history of skin disorders. The patient took no medicines, no known drug allergies and was up to date on all vaccines. On an unknown date the patient was vaccinated with first dose of GARDASIL. Concomitant medications were not reported. A few days after receiving her first dose, the patient developed pruritic eruption of the arms, legs, trunk and neck diagnosed as lichenoid drug eruption. The patient initially sought treatment in the emergency department, where she received hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine and triamcinolone cream, but none of these agents improved her symptoms after 1 month of treatment. Physical examination revealed violaceous planar papules and plaques on the chest, lumbar back, extensor and flexural extremities, dorsal hands, palms and soles. Mucous membranes and nails appeared normal. A punch biopsy of a representative plaque on the left hip was performed. Histopathology demonstrated compact hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis, a saw tooth rete ridge pattern with a lymphocytic infiltrate and rare eosinophils. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of lichenoid drug eruption (LDE). A 4-week prednisone taper improved the eruption dramatically. The action taken with GARDASIL was withdrawn (reported as advised to refrain from receiving subsequent vaccines). The outcome of lichenoid drug eruption was reported as recovered (reported as at her 6-week follow-up visit, the patient had only significant postinflammatory hyperpigmentation). The reporter considered the event lichenoid drug eruption to be related to GARDASIL. The GARDASIL contains relatively inert additives. It contains aluminum, which has been associated with cutaneous reactions. Additional information has been requested."
603901-1,"This letter is to describe the adverse reaction that I had to my pneumonia vaccine that I received the morning of September 24th 2015. I am a RN and have administered many injections over my 41 years of practice. I knew immediately that when I got both the flu and the pneumonia injections that they were both administered too high in the deltoid muscle and mentioned this to a couple other nurses that I work with immediately after my injections. The flu injection was given in my left arm and the pneumonia injection was given in my right arm. I have never that the pneumonia vaccine before so when it started hurting within a couple hours, I really did not think too much of it. I work in an office setting and was sitting at my desk all day, so there was nothing I did physically with my shoulder that day. I did ask a couple other nurses later that day if anyone had really painful shoulder but no one I spoke with had the pneumonia vaccine. At the same time as the pain in my right shoulder was increasing, I also began to have dental pain in multiple teeth on the right side of my face. Later that evening the pain in my right shoulder got much worse and I could not even undress without help to go to bed. Both the dental pain and the right shoulder became much worse the following day. I happened to have an appointment with my PCP on Friday morning. I asked him if was possible to have a shoulder injury from a vaccination. He had not heard of this and told me to keep my arm moving and use ice or heat which ever felt better. At first I did not relate the dental pain to this injection as I had had a gum graft on 2 of my right top teeth 2 + weeks earlier. The pain from that had pretty much subsided several days earlier. As Friday progressed both the dental and the right shoulder pain became increasingly more severe. I could not move my right arm at all due to the pain. It was about 5 pm on Friday evening that I realized that the injection sire was not sore at all. The right shoulder pain was deep inside my anterior portion of my shoulder where my rotator cuff would be. The pain became so exquisite that around 6 pm I went to the pharmacy and spoke with the pharmacist. He could not explain my pain either. He gave me the PCV13 vaccine form and told me I should file and adverse reaction form."

She denied fever, chills, upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, or mucous membrane involvement. On an unknown date, the patient presented with a two week history of a severely pruritic, vesiculobullous eruption on her legs, arms and lower abdomen that developed 2 days after she had received an influenza vaccination. The rash began as tiny pink papules and then formed vesicles. Physical examination revealed symmetrically distributed discrete, pink papules, vesicles and bullae over her lower extremities, hands, forearms and lower abdomen with particular concentration on the medial surfaces of her calves. She had no conjunctival injection, involvement of mucous membranes, palms or soles. Microscopic examination of a biopsy from the left calf revealed a subepidermal blistering process with neutrophils. Direct immunofluorescence revealed linear deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) along the basement membrane zone. The test was negative for immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, C3 (complement factor 3) and fibrinogen. This findings in conjunction with the histology were most suggestive of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD). The patient was treated with diphenhydramine and cetirizine by her primary care physician but continued to get new lesions. She had not tried topical corticosteroids or any other treatments. She discontinued rosuvastatin and switched back to brand name ZOLOFT (sertraline) with no improvement. The eruption cleared after two courses of prednisone followed by a mid potency topical corticosteroid and did not recur when she restarted generic sertraline and rosuvastatin. The eruption lasted 6 weeks in total. Case outcome: patient recovered. Case underwent manual correction in preparation for data migration: key vaccine added. Automated Data Corrections (01-JUN-2016 14:31:13): Set IME events to serious for Spontaneous and PMS cases (significant change). Set missing ""As Reported"" for MedDRA coded laboratory tests to preferred terms. Correct units of measurement for laboratory tests. Create history record and set the last received date for corrected cases. Reporter's Comments: The reporter considered that the event was triggered by the influenza vaccination. The case was reported as serious due to medical significance. Sender's Comments: The company considered event causality possible to influenza vaccination. The patient had several medical conditions and was taking concomitant medications. Information derived from this AE report does not change the current safety profile of the product."

386227-1,"Information has been received from a published article. A cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study was conducted among nurses employed in surgical and gynecological wards of 16 randomly selected hospitals. The objective of this cross-sectional sero-survey was to determine the vaccination coverage for hepatitis B and the prevalence of anti-HBC, an anonymous sero-survey of surgical/gynecological nurses. This report was part of a post-marketing surveillance program. On an unspecified date a female nurse was administered a booster dose of RECOMBIVAX HB. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced hepatitis B and was hospitalized. Of note, all staff infected with HBV without clinical manifestation of hepatitis B were vaccinated. It could be possible that some nurses were infected with HBV in the pre-vaccination era and were not tested for the markers of a previous infection before the immunization procedure. Another possible explanation of anti-HBc positive cases among those vaccinated with HBV is that some nurses were vaccinated, but did not respond. As the anti HBs titer was not checked after the vaccination course they were not aware of the fact they were part of a non-responder group. As they were still vulnerable to HBV, they contracted the infection. As shown conclusively by the study, some anti-HBC positive nurses might be vaccinated for HBV without previous screening, so clear recommendations for pre-vaccination screening should be established and strictly followed by those responsible for vaccination procedures. As the majority of the HBV nurses were not aware of their serological response after the immunization with hepatitis B vaccine, testing for anti-HBs after vaccination remains crucial. This data underscored the importance of Hepatitis B for health care workers. The study documents the ability to obtain 100% vaccination coverage in nursing staff, an important goal in reducing the risk of HBV infection in this and other health care worker population. No further information is available. This is one of several reports, received from the same source."
396328-1,"Information was obtained on request by the company from the agency via a public case details form concerning a 56 year old female patient who on 21-MAY-2010, was subcutaneously vaccinated with a dose of MMR II. Secondary suspect vaccination included VARIVAX (manufacturer unknown, subcutaneously) and yellow fever virus vaccine (Manufacturer unknown, subcutaneously, Batch E5061-2). On 21-MAY-2010, immediate before vaccination the patient experienced erythema, mild facial oedema, was unable to swallow, had difficulty breathing, felt that neck and throat were swollen and felt very weak. Over the 21-MAY-2010 and 22-MAY-2010, episodes of swollen throat and difficulty swallowing reoccurred while decreasing in intensity and duration. The patient also experienced headaches and she felt like she had a lump in her throat for a few days. The patient was treated with oxygen via Hudson mask, PHENERGAN 50 mg IM, ADRENALINE 1:1000 0.5 mL IM, she was observed and an ambulance was called. The patient was admitted to hospital for less than six hours and was treated with prednisolone and antihistamine. At the time of reporting, the patient was feeling tired and like she had a sore tongue and the patient's outcome was unknown. The agency considered that anaphylactic reaction was possible related to therapy with MMR II, VARIVAX (manufacturer unknown, Subcutaneously) and yellow fever virus vaccine (Manufacturer unknown, subcutaneously, Batch E5061-2). The original reporting source was not provided. No further information is available."

412780-1,"This female subject was enrolled in the study.  On 29 November 2010, the subject received the 1st dose of TWINRIX in the right deltoid.  The subject's past medical history included a pregnancy that resulted in an abortion induced complete (see case id A0836278A for more details).  On 30 November 2010, one day after the 1st dose of TWINRIX, this 23-year-old subject developed (probable) viral hepatitis.  The subject was hospitalised.  The subject was treated with methylprednisolone sodium succinate.  The event was unresolved at time of reporting.  The investigator reported the (probable) viral hepatitis as possibly related to TWINRIX.  The investigator stated that although it is unlikely that this event has relationship with the vaccine, given the short time elapsed between the vaccination and the onset date, the event was considered as possibly related with the TWINRIX.  On 06 December 2010, the subject's attending doctor from the local hospital called to the study clinic and reported that on 30 November 2010, the subject consulted due to fever, abdominal pain predominantly on the right upper quadrant, vomiting and ocular pain.  She was evaluated in the emergency room (ER) and was discharged.  He said that on 05 December 2010, she consulted again at the ER due to the same symptoms, where she already reached more than 24 hours under observation.  Laboratory tests performed on 05 December 2010 showed increased hepatic enzymes and thrombocytopenia until 50,000 /mm3.  The attending doctors from the local hospital consider the event as a severe reaction to TWINRIX.  Currently, she is receiving treatment.  Follow-up will be given.  The medical chart review will be performed when possible.  Diagnosis: (Probable) viral hepatitis."

426026-1,"This case was reported by a physician via a sales representative and described the occurrence of cellulitis in a 8 year-old female subject who was vaccinated with INFANRIX (GlaxoSmithKline). Concurrent vaccination included unspecified vaccines (multiple other childhood vaccines - manufacturer unspecified) given on the same date as INFANRIX. On an unspecified date the subject received unspecified dose of INFANRIX at 0.5 ml in an unknown thigh. Within a couple of days of vaccination with INFANRIX, the subject experienced cellulitis. Signs included injection site redness, hot (injection site hot to touch) and swelling. The physician considered the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention). The subject was treated with KEFLEX. The subject resolved on therapy. Product complaint was noted. The site claimed good aseptic technique was followed and there was no change in the appearance of the vaccine administered. It was reported that cellulitis was probably related to treatment with INFANRIX. A note was made that other childhood vaccines were given at the same time, but infections have occurred only at either INFANRIX or KINRIX injection sites or that leg affected. Four subjects received INFANRIX from lot number AC14B126AA with expiration date 03 March 2013 and one subject each received KINDRIX from lot number AC20B168AA with expiration date 02 December 2012 and lot number AC20B164BA with expiration 13 October 2012 (six subjects affected in total ranging in age from 15 months to 8 years).

435140-1,"This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician via a foreign Medicines Agency, regulatory authority number NO-NOMAADVRE-FHI-2011-12714. A 5-month-old female girl born 14Jun2010 received the first vaccination dose of PREVENAR and INFANRIX-POLIO+HIB on 29Nov2010. Relevant medical history included: She was a premature baby, born in 26th week. Weight at birth was 795 g, and for the first four weeks she needed breathing assistance in form of a respirator and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Except from treatment for an infection after birth, she had been healthy and showed good development by the age of three weeks. Concomitant medications were not reported. A couple of hours after the injections she felt warm. During the next 24 hours, she became increasingly unwell, lost the appetite and the parents suspected that she was constipated. Early night time approximately 36 hours after vaccination, her respiration became irregular. Heart failure, pulmonary failure, sudden death, heart enlarged, pneumonitis and appetite lost were reported as events. It was reported that she had pulmonary changes which might be consisted with chronic pneumonitis in infancy. She died on 01Dec2010 after resuscitation. Cause of death as per post mortem report: death probably due to heart/lung failure. The foreign Medicines Agency assessed the causality between the two suspect products and death as possible. The reporter noted lung disease without association to vaccine could have caused heart failure. Premature infants with additional diseases could be particular susceptible to apnea after vaccination, but should still follow the same vaccination program as full term-born infants. No additional information is available at this time. No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected."
462510-1,"Case number PHHY2012NZ070904 is an initial literature report received on 15 Aug 2012. Authors presented a case of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) and recurrent IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in an renal transplant recipient following influenza vaccination. This case refers to a 49-year old female patient. At age 33 she had hematuria, proteinuria, and biopsy proven IgAN that progressed to end-stage renal failure (ESRF), without features of HSP, over 6 years. She underwent renal transplantation (living-related donor) and at age 41. She was vaccinated with influenza vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: unknown, hence it was considered as influenza unknown INN) on an unspecified date. Ten days after vaccination, she presented with a progressive, palpable purpuric rash. On presentation blood pressure was 132/77 mmHg, serum creatinine 100 micromol/L, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 51 ml/min/1,73 m^2 (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula). Urinalysis revealed less than 10x10^6/L white and red blood cells (RBC's), no casts, and total protein creatinine ratio (TPCR) 17.8 g/mol. Platelet count, coagulation profile, and rapid vasculitis screen were unremarkable. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with positive immunofluorescence for IgA. A diagnosis for HSP was made. Seven weeks later, microscopic hematuria (50-100 x 10^6/L RBC's) was noted, which persisted at six months, along with development of cellular casts, dysmorphic RBC's, nephrotic range proteinuria (urine TPCR 658.1 g/mol), and hypertension (148/96 mmHg). Renal function remained stable (creatinine 102 micromol/L, eGFR 50 ml/min/1.73 m^2). Renal biopsy showed active IgAN with focal crescent formation. Influenza vaccination was considered the trigger for HSP, followed by recurrent IgAN. The outcome and seriousness was not reported. Authors concluded that nephrologists should be cognizant of the potential for allograft dysfunction following influenza vaccination in renal transplant recipients whose primary cause of ESRF was HSP or IgAN."
464435-1,"My symptoms began the morning after I woke up from having the flu shot the previous afternoon with a finger that I could not move and breathing difficulty. This progressed over the following months to incredible pain and immobility in all of the joints and muscles throughout my entire body along with incredible fatigue, muscle spasms and twitches and a host of other symptoms affecting every organ, muscle, joint and nervous system. Almost two years after the flu shot, I am still dealing with the muscle/joint pain in my entire neck and back.  It took 9 doctors and 8 months for someone to figure out what the flu shot had done to me which was an inflammatory response of the peripheral nervous system which impacted the facia throughout my body. Previous to the diagnosis I had seen rheumatologists, neurologists and other doctors to try and figure out how to rid my body of this terrible pain and the impact that it was having on my life. I had symptoms similar to Lyme disease, MS etc but I did not have a disease, I had a reaction. I was repeatedly tested for these. I have spent almost every single week since that flu shot going to a doctors appointment, chiropractic appointments and physical massage therapy appointments to relieve the constant pain, stiffness and soreness in my muscles. This has taken not only my time but a great deal of out of pocket money spent on trying to get better from this. Thousands of dollars have been spent through insurance and personal funds to improve the damage that the flu shot has caused. It has been an absolutely terrible experience to be a perfectly healthy person one day and to have this much daily pain the two years since then. I would like for someone from VAERS to contact me to discuss my case. I will be able to provide all medical information, records and expenses as a result of this experience."
475690-1,"Case number PHHY2012JP108900 is an initial literature report received on 21 Nov 2012: The authors have presented a case of optic neuritis after H1N1 flu vaccination in a young child on peritoneal dialysis: This report refers to a 3-year-old male child. His medical history included chronic renal failure secondary to bilateral hypoplastic kidneys. He had been on peritoneal dialysis (PD) since 10-month-old of age. He was vaccinated with a pandemic influenza vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: unknown) on an unspecified date. He became ill tempered on an unspecified date. Two days later, he experienced visual impairment which was noticed by parents and he was hospitalized the next day. It was found he had received a vaccination of H1N1 flu ten days before the admission. On examination, his general condition was good; however, his pupil was dilated and he did not respond to light stimulation in both eyes. On fundus examination bilateral papilledema was observed. He had no other abnormal neurological findings including ocular movement. A brain magnetic resonance imaging and an electroencephalogram were normal. The doctors made a diagnosis of optic neuritis and employed methylprednisolone pulse (MP) therapy three times and supplementation of oral vitamins with continuing PD. However, he was left with severe visual impairment one month later. He had transient hyponatremia during the MP therapy. The authors concluded that reports of optic neuritis after vaccination were infrequently found; however, the relation between optic neuritis and chronic renal failure was not pointed out specifically."

480239-1,"Information has been received from a published article. Abstract: The human papillomavirus quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) recombinant vaccine is effective in preventing cervical, vulva, vaginal and anal cancer. Maximal protection is achieved with completion of all three recommended doses. A retrospective chart review was performed to assess the current vaccine series completion rates in a private practice multispecialty suburban setting and identify factors associated with failure to complete the vaccine series. Chi-square and independent samples t test were used for data analysis. A total of 4,117 patients out of 10,821 eligible patients received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine between 01-OCT-2006 and 30-APR-2010. Overall, 69.5% (n = 2,863) of patients who received one dose of the HPV vaccine completed all three doses in a valid time frame, representing 26.5% of all eligible patients. Patients who completed the series were younger (16.8 vs. 18.2, p < 0.05), less likely to have a sexually transmitted disease diagnosis prior to initiation of the series (57.7 vs. 69.8%, p < 0.05), and more likely to have visited the pediatrics department compared to family medicine, internal medicine, and OB/GYN departments (75.9, 65.7, 57.0, 60.9%, respectively, p < 0.05). Deaths, pregnancies, and adverse drug reactions were not identified as independent factors impacting completion rates. The results indicate that adolescents, patients visiting the pediatrics department and those without a prior STD diagnosis completed the vaccination series more frequently than adults managed in family medicine, internal medicine, and OB/GYN departments. Result: The review of the randomly selected 10% sample of 411 patient charts for adverse reactions identified four patients (less than one percent) who experienced an adverse event within 30 days of vaccine administration. Two patients reported an injection site reaction, which is the most common documented ADR for HPV vaccination. One patient reported a systemic viral infection and one patient reported a genital HPV infection, neither of which was determined to be related to the vaccine. Of the four patients who experienced an adverse event, one completed the series and three patients did not. This report concerns the 2 patients that reported injection site reaction which is most common documented ADR for HPV vaccination. Event outcome was not mentioned. No further information is available."

502344-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of injection site abscess in a 30-day-old male subject who was vaccinated with Hepatitis B (manufacturer unspecified). The subject had no history of diseases or trauma. On an unspecified date the subject received unspecified dose of Hepatitis B (unknown, left thigh). Less than one week after vaccination with Hepatitis B, the subject experienced injection site abscess with progressive injection site swelling, injection site redness and injected limb mobility decreased. Physical examination revealed approximately 3x2 cm, erythematous, indurated, tender to palpation, fluctuating soft tissue swelling over anterolateral left thigh. Heat increase was detected over lesion. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cells count of 15.2?109/L, a sedimentation rate of 25 mm/h, a C-reactive protein level of 71 mg/L. A direct radiography showed no lesion except soft tissue swelling. The superficial tissue ultrasonography demonstrated 44x31x80 mm, dense collection which was extended to distal femur, not in connection with the knee joint. Abscess- hematoma differentiation could not be made, in the left anterior femur. After making thigh abscess initial diagnosis, a sterile needle puncture was performed to fluctuating soft tissue in operation room. During needle puncture, 15 cc purulent liquid was aspirated. As the liquid was purulent, irrigation and debridement were performed. The culture of aspirated fluid revealed a Staphylococcus aureus infection. The other believed that the abscess was caused by use of inappropriate vaccination technique without paying attention to sterility. The subject was treated with cefotaxime, metronidazole and teicoplanin. Complete recovery was achieved after three month- follow up.

On 17 September 2009, the physician diagnosed the subject with strabismus. The subject was clearly stepping and the moro reflex was seen and felt slightly hypotonic. The subject did not put weight on her feet when lifted up into a vertical position. She raised her head well in prone position. The subject was referred to a hospital for further examination. The subject's mother said that the subject had strabismus throughout her infancy, especially when the subject was tired and her left eye was squint. Hirschberg test was normal, but when the subject observed her surroundings the right eye squints inward at times and at times the left eye squinted. One third of the vaginal orifice was covered by a thin clear film, nothing abnormal was observed in the external genetilia. In September 2009, the subject had episodes of shaking and convulsions which lasted approximately 15-30 seconds during her sleep and the eyes deviated upwards. During these attacks the subject could not be woken up and eye contact was not made. On 8 October 2009, the subject was admitted for 24 hours for monitoring, due to seizure symptoms. Apnoea monitoring and laboratory tests were performed. On 9 October 2009, the subject was consulted by a neurologist and EEG was conducted. The child was very tearful and hypotonic in the first 3 months of her life and had to be carried constantly. The mouth remained open. There were very rare spontaneous movements. The wrists could readily bent into volar flexion. Her head could not be held. The subject had otitis in both the ears. The subject was treated with Valproate for the seizure symptoms. Later it was titrated down and then stopped due to elevated urine ammonia. The subject was monitored by ear and eye specialists and cardiologists. On 23 October 2009, a myringotomy was conducted and ventilation tubes were inserted. The subject was also treated with glasses for the strabismus. The subject had short term seizures during sleep or after breast feeding in association with reflux. In November 2008, the child was diagnosed with reflux disease and in spring of 2010, an allergy to milk was detected. Extensive laboratory tests were conducted which included EEG, CSF, sleep deprivation EEG, ultrasound examination, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, various reflux examination and electromyogram. On 12 October 2009, the ultrasound of head slowly visibility of deep regions of the brain with no diagnostic results, nothing specific in the visible areas. Ultrasound of heart was normal. In autumn 2010, electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials test, gene determination and molecular karyotyping tests were performed. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events was unspecified. The cause for the subject's development delay, strabismus and susceptibility to infections could not be found. No further information was expected, the regulatory authority has provided to GSK with all the available information for the time being, if they ever get any further information they will send it to GSK. Therefore the case has been closed."
526358-1,"This spontaneous report as received from a nurse practitioner refers to her daughter (age not reported). On an unknown date in 2008 the patient was vaccinated with booster dose of VARIVAX (Merck) subcutaneous (lot #, dose, strength, site and route of administration not reporter). Concomitant therapies included vitamins (unspecified), OMEGA-3 and high doses (not specified) of vitamin d (unspecified). The reporter stated that her twins, boy (captured in MARRS # 1403USA007224) and girl experienced severe reactions after vaccination with booster dose of VARIVAX (Merck). On an unknown date in 2008 the patient experienced generalized lymphadenopathy and very large urticaria on her thigh which covered her almost entire thigh and profuse itching. Her daughter also experienced bruising, petechia and profuse nose bleeds following VARIVAX (Merck) vaccination and these symptoms lasted for several days. About a month after vaccination with VARIVAX (Merck) had another giant urticaria in her arm had similar nose bleeding and bruising issues. Nurse practitioner stated that these bleeding symptoms improved somewhat after several days but her daughter intermittently experienced nosed bleeds and bruising for about a year following vaccination. About a year after VARIVAX (Merck) dose, her daughter was tested and found to have abnormal platelet function and her platelet level dropped. The outcome of generalized lymphadenopathy, platelet level dropped, abnormal platelet function, petechia, profuse itching and very large urticaria on her thigh was not reported. The relatedness between generalized lymphadenopathy, platelet level dropped, abnormal platelet function, petechia, nose bleeding, bruising profuse itching and very large urticaria on her thigh and therapy with VARIVAX (Merck) was unknown. The reporter stated that her children were very sensitive to vaccines and she's been closely working with allergist and immunologist to find the cause for these reactions. This is one of two same patient cases from the same source (second case MARRS # 1403USA007227). This is one of several cases from the same source (other cases MARRS # 1403USA007224, 1403USA007225, 1403USA003195, 1403USA007227, 1403USA007228). Additional information is not expected."
526661-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of partial paralysis of abducent nerve in a 4-day-old male subject who was vaccinated with ENGERIX B (GlaxoSmithKline). The subject was born at 39 weeks of gestation by caesarean section due to prolonged labour following an uncomplicated pregnancy. There was no reported history of febrile illness or trauma and a photography from day 1 of life showed normal eye abduction. A maternal uncle had a history of strabismus. No further information on his medical, family history or concurrent medication was available. On an unspecified date, at 2-day of life, the subject received 1st dose of ENGERIX B (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided). 2 days after vaccination with ENGERIX B, the subject experienced partial paralysis of abducent nerve and esotropia. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. On ophthalmological examination, he showed marked limitation of abduction in the right eye (-3) and full ductions in the left eye. This was consistent with right lateral rectus paralysis. He blinked to light with each eye. Dilated fundus examination was normal. His paediatrician performed a neurological examination that was notable only for the abducens nerve palsy. MRI of the brain and orbits, with and without contrast, was performed and T1- and T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted images with fat suppression revealed no abnormalities. Diagnosis was isolated abducens nerve palsy. The treatment consisted of part-time occlusion therapy of his left eye. Examination on day 30 of life revealed a 60 degree right esotropia in primary gaze at near. Cycloplegic refraction revealed +13.25 D spherical error for each eye. He maintained fixation in adduction in the right eye and had central, steady, and maintained fixation in his left eye. At 2 months of age the esotropia had resolved and he was orthotropic in primary gaze, with full abduction of the right eye. Patching was discontinued at this visit. Examinations at 4, 12, and 18 months of age revealed orthotropia in primary gaze, with no limitation of abduction of the right eye. His vision was 9.8 cycles per degree (20/60, within normal range) in each eye using teller acuity cards at the 18-month of age follow-up examination. The author's conclusion stated that they believed that his sixth nerve palsy was caused by the vaccination, although other, less likely, possibilities include cryptogenic or unreported trauma. Presumed postimmunization abducens nerve palsy typically resolves spontaneously within 6 months, although it was often associated with a recurrence."

541482-1,"Information has been received from Sanofi Pasteur MSD (SPM) (manufacturer control # E2014-07431) on 26-AUG-2014. Case regarding adverse events and pregnancy follow-up received from Patient Insurance Company via Health Authorities on 21-Aug-2014 under the reference numbers DK-DKMA-ADR 22658534 and PIC 14-2452. The primary reporter was a lawyer. This case is linked to case E2014-07428, concerning a baby born with birth defect after drug exposure before pregnancy. A 34-year-old female patient with no reported medical history, had received three doses of GARDASIL (batch number not reported) via I.M. route of administration in unspecified site of administration on 01-Aug-2011, 10-Oct-2011 and 16-Jan-2012. Later on in Feb-2014 she developed sclerosis. The woman experienced a spontaneous abortion in week 12 on 05-Apr-2012. She developed severe migraine in Aug-2011 and had a massive bleeding on 01-Aug-2011 (recovery date reported as Jan-2012). She developed a sleeping sensation of both feet for 24 hours on 06-Feb-2014 and an upward sensory disturbance in lower part of body on 07-Feb-2014. Drug exposure before pregnancy was reported with onset 01-Aug-2011 and end date of 16-Jan-2012. HA reported in medical history that the patient developed fever, sore throat and laryngitis on 26-Mar-2012, with outcome unknown. The company considered relevant to code these as adverse events after vaccination, according to company procedures. Correspondingly, the penicillin used for treatment of laryngitis was coded as drug to treat AE, by company (considered concomitant by HA). It was reported that the Patient Insurance Company (PIC) has come to a decision regarding this request. Decision: The patient is not entitled to compensation. The Facts: The patient sought compensation because she believes that she has had adverse reactions to the HPV-vaccination. She has stated that she after each vaccine had massive (genital) bleeding where she during one hour soaked 4-6 overnight towel pads. In addition, she had a miscarriage in April 2012 in week 12, and in 2013 she gave birth to a daughter with hidden spina bifida (the daughter's adverse event is reported in the linked case E2014-07428 (DK-DKMA-ADR 22658530)). In February 2014 the patient was diagnosed with sclerosis. PIC has, based on the review of the claim, medical records and the other information, established the following sequence of events as the basis for decision: The patient was vaccinated with GARDASIL on 01-Aug-2011. On 18-Sep-2011 she received influenza vaccination (reported as concomitant vaccination). In connection with the appointment to the second vaccination the patient reported that she at first vaccination had side effects with severe migraine and massive bleeding. The patient received the second vaccination on 10-Oct-2011. On 16-Jan-2012 she got third vaccination with GARDASIL. In the medical record on 27-Feb-2012 from her doctor, it was noted that the patient was pregnant. On 26-Mar-2012 patient had fever and sore throat and was given penicillin (brand or MFR not rep.) for sore throat. On 05-Apr-2012 the patient was admitted with bleeding. There was no fetus, and estimating that the patient probably had a miscarriage. In the medical record from her doctor it was noted on 09-Jul-2012 that the patient was pregnant. She gave birth on 28-Feb-2013 (baby described in linked case E2014-07428). On 07-Feb-2014 the patient described numbness in both feet for one day. The patient was admitted with an upward sensory disturbance in lower part of body. She was diagnosed with sclerosis after studies (tests or examinations not specified). Justification: PIC had concluded that there is no causal relationship between HPV-vaccine and subsequent massive bleeding, miscarriage, migraines and multiple sclerosis. Patient Compensation has emphasized that the events are not described in the official database for GARDASIL. In addition to the database, the PIC emphasized that there is no medical evidence of a cau"
580004-1,"Initial unsolicited literature report received on 18 May 2015. A 55-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of left shoulder pain occurring less than 24 hrs after receiving an Influenza vaccination and a Tdap vaccination. She described her pain as dull/achy, 5 out of 10 (10-point scale with 10 being the worst pain) at rest, and exacerbating with shoulder manipulation, most notably with abduction. In addition, she reported persistent 3-4/10 dull pain at rest, sleep disturbances due to pain, and difficulty with lifting, carrying and driving. The patient denied prior shoulder pain, fever, redness, soft tissue swelling, interval trauma, excessive lifting, pulling or exercising. Physical exam findings were positive for left deltoid tenderness, restricted adduction, and tenderness upon passive abduction and arm elevation reflexes, strength, and sensation were intact. Serum C-reactive protein was normal. After minimal avail from multiple sessions of physical therapy and oral pain medications, a non-enhanced MRI of the left shoulder was ordered. Imaging Findings: Initial non-enhanced MRI of the left shoulder demonstrated abnormal osseous edema in the lateral humeral head and neck, and abnormal soft tissue edema in the teres minor muscle, including its myotendinous junction and humeral insertion. These post-injection findings were attributed to sequela from direct needle impact and reactive change related to the injected material. A 3-month follow-up (after an ineffective subacromial corticosteroid injection) non enhanced MRI demonstrated ongoing inflammatory disease as evidenced by new visualization of an 8-mm humeral head cortical erosion. The patient's pain persists, but at approximately 6 weeks post-injection, her pain with sleep reduced from 4/10 to 2/10. In addition, her rest pain reduced from 5/10 to 3/10 at approximately 7 weeks but with persistent mild restricted motion on physical exam. Diagnosis: Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA). Less likely differential considerations include focal septic arthritis, calcific tendinitis with intraosseous penetration, gout, and seronegative spondylorathropathic enthesopathy. A 55-year old female patient, whose medical history and concomitant medications were not reported, had received a dose of Influenza vaccine (batch number and expiry date, route and site of administration were not reported) and also received a dose of Tdap (batch number and expiry date, route and site of administration were not reported) on unspecified date. On unspecified, post vaccination the patient had experienced symptoms like left shoulder pain / left deltoid tenderness, pain exacerbating with shoulder manipulation, most notably with abduction / mild restricted motion / difficulty with lifting, carrying and driving, pain as dull or achy at rest / dull pain at rest, sleep disturbances due to pain. A 3-month follow-up (after an ineffective subacromial corticosteroid injection) non-enhanced MRI demonstrated ongoing inflammatory disease as evidenced by new visualization of an 8-mm humeral head cortical erosion. The patient's pain persists, but at approximately 6 weeks post-injection, her pain with sleep reduced from 4/10 to 2/10. In addition, her rest pain reduced from 5/10 to 3/10 at approximately 7 weeks but with persistent mild restricted motion on physical exam. No information about prior exposure to vaccine was provided. On unspecified, post vaccination the patient had experienced shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA). Prolonged shoulder pain occurring acutely after vaccination should prompt physicians to incorporate SIRVA in their differential of possible causes. In addition, vaccine administrators in healthcare facilities nationwide should be educated on the potential risks (physician and economic) of over-penetration associated with the current CDC's needle length recommendations. Laboratory investigations and subacromial corticosteroid injection was given as c"

The patient's ears and her throat were ""bothering her"" so the physician prescribed oral antibiotics for her. No tests were done during the visit to determine if she had an infection. The patient was administered PNEUMOVAX 23 (lot # L012215, expiration date: January 2017, dose and route were not reported) on 27-OCT-2015, because she was not running a fever and the physician determined it was safe to administer. Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics, ""something for nausea"" and ""something for pain/headache"", unspecified blood pressure medication and unspecified cholesterol medication. After the visit, on an unspecified date in October 2015, the patient developed a very large welt at the injection site, her head was ""killing her"" and she had a fever climbing over 102 (units not provided) and she couldn't stop vomiting. She was taken to the emergency room (ER) in the evening of 29-OCT-2015 and kept for observation. The tests for flu and strep performed on the same day came back negative.

A 14-month-old male patient of an unspecified ethnicity received PREVENAR 13 (Lot/Batch # M37096), intramuscular in the right thigh on 08Jun2016 at 0.5 ml, single for immunisation. Medical history included influenza in Feb2016. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient, after receiving PREVENAR 13 vaccination, developed apathy on Jun2016 with outcome of recovered, altered behaviour on Jun2016 with outcome of recovered, breathlessness-like abnormal breathing on 12Jun2016 with outcome of recovered, convulsion on Jun2016 with outcome of recovered, encephalopathy on Jun2016 with outcome of recovered, fever on Jun 2016 with outcome of recovered, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode on 12Jun2016 with outcome of recovered, urticaria on 16Jun2016 with outcome of recovered. Clinical course was reported as follows: The patient was healthy on 08Jun2016 at the time of the vaccination with PREVENAR 13. On 11Jun2016 or 12Jun2016 his behaviour changed, like he was not himself. He reportedly had encephalopathy. Encephalopathy and altered behaviour persisted for 3-4 days and then resolved. The patient developed hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode on two occasions, first on 12Jun2016 and then on 15Jun2016, he fell on his back and head from an upright standing position. He was sitting in his feeding chair staring, not paying attention to the parents. It was reported that the patient was apathic and had convulsion, which resolved. The patient had fever, 38-39 degrees, in the afternoon and evening. On 12Jun2016 and 13Jun2016 he had strange breathing, similar to breathlessness. He had urticaria on 16Jun2016 and 17Jun2016. No medical intervention was reported. The patient had no reported medical condition other than flu in Feb 2016 and had no concomitant medications. The vaccination site did not change and did not turn red. The case is being investigated by the Centre. Sender's comments: Fever, urticaria, breathlessness, convulsion and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode are expected adverse events, listed in the SmPC of PREVENAR 13. Encephalopathy, apathy and abnormal behaviour are unexpected adverse events. Based on the limited information available, considering the reported inconclusive dates and durations of the adverse events, lack of medical confirmation of diagnoses, no reliable causality assessment can be provided. It should be noted that the reported events and longtime interval to onset does not fully meet the criteria of the diagnosis of hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode. Although the parent reported clinically significant events including encephalopathy, breathlessness and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, the reporter did not provide seriousness criteria for the case. It was not reported whether medical help was sought. The case is considered serious based on the reported medically significant events encephalopathy, breathlessness and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode. No follow-up attempts are needed.

This case is linked to 2015SA146032, 2015SA146043, 2015SA146045, 2015SA146046, 2015SA146047,2015SA146048, 2015SA146049, 2015SA146050, 2015SA146051, 2015SA146052, 2015SA146053, 2015SA146054, 2015SA146055, 2015SA146056, 2015SA146057, 2015SA146058, 2015SA146059, 2015SA146060, 2015SA146061, 2015SA146062, 2015SA146063, 2015SA146065, 2015SA146066 and 2015SA146067 (Same literature). The following is verbatim from the article: Background: Reporting of adverse events (AEs) following vaccination can help identify rare or unexpected complications of immunizations and aid in characterizing potential vaccine safety signals. We developed an open-source, generalizable clinical decision support system called Electronic Support for Public Health-Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (ESP-VAERS) to assist clinicians with AE detection and reporting. Methods: ESP-VAERS monitors patient's electronic health records for new diagnoses, changes in laboratory values and new allergies following vaccinations. When suggestive events are found, ESP-VAERS sends the patient's clinician a secure electronic message with an invitation to affirm or refute the message, add comments, and submit an automated, prepopulated electronic report to VAERS. High-probability AEs are reported automatically if the clinician does not respond. We implemented ESP-VAERS in December 2012 throughout the System, an integrated healthcare system. We queried the VAERS database to determine System's baseline reporting rates from January 2009 to March 2012 and then assessed changes in reporting rates with ESP-VAERS. Results: In the 8 months following implementation, 91 622 vaccinations were given. ESP-VAERS sent 1385 messages to responsible clinicians describing potential AEs. Clinicians opened 1304 (94.2 percent) messages, responded to 209 (15.1 percent), and confirmed 16 for transmission to VAERS. An additional 16 high-probability AEs were sent automatically. Reported events included seizure, pleural effusion, and lymphocytopenia. The odds of a VAERS report submission during the implementation period were 30.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 9.52-95.5) times greater than the odds during the comparable preimplementation period. Conclusions: An open-source, electronic health record-based clinical decision support system can increase AE detection and reporting rates in VAERS. This case involves a patient (age and gender not reported), who was vaccinated with a dose of INFLUENZA VACCINE (IIV) (manufacturer: unknown, batch number, route, dose in series and site of administration were not reported) on an unspecified date. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On unspecified date following the vaccination, the patient developed a possible allergic reaction to the vaccine. Lab tests and corrective treatments were not reported. Outcome of event was not reported. Documents held by sender: none. Follow-up information received from physician on 19 October 2015.

645762-1,"This literature study report has been received from the authors of published literature article, concerning the subject of an unknown age and gender. The subject's concurrent condition included haematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT), Fanconi anemia and immunosuppression. The subject's medical history and concomitant therapies were not reported. The aim of this multi-centre clinical trial was to determine the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of HPV vaccine in immunocompromised children. Rolling recruitment occurred across the three sites, with the first subject recruited in 14-NOV-2007, and the last in 25-AUG-2010. Unvaccinated children 5-18 years of age attending one of three pediatric hospitals with a range of specified conditions associated with immunosuppression were eligible for inclusion in the study. The rationale for including younger children was the risk of accelerated, early onset Human Papillomavirus (HPV) related cancers in immunosuppression, and the need to understand immunogenicity in this age group. Each hospital recruited from defined subjects groups. This included solid organ transplantation (liver (LT) or kidney (KT)) (at hospital 1, 2 and 3), HSCT within the previous 12 months (at hospital 1), or an autoimmune disorder (juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)) (at hospital 2). The subjects were excluded if they were aged > 18 years or <5 years, had been previously immunized against HPV, had a platelet count of <50 x 10^9/ml (intramuscular vaccination), had received immunoglobulin therapy within the preceding three months, had received a kidney transplant within the preceding 6 months or had a documented allergy to yeast or to any other vaccine component. Children attending hospital 2 were excluded from the study if they had a flare of their JIA or IBD in the preceding three months. Informed consent from the parents was obtained prior to any vaccination. On an unspecified dates, three doses of GARDASIL, 0.5 ml, intramuscular were given to the subjects in the study according to the following protocols: HSCT subjects received three doses of GARDASIL, the first dose was given 6-12 months post-transplant, with the second and the third doses given at 2 and 6 months following the first dose; for prospective LT subjects, the first dose was given pretransplant to optimize immunogenicity and memory cell production, with the second two doses post transplantation in the same intervals mentioned above for HSCT subjects; for KT recipients the first dose was given at least six months following transplantation. The follow-up LT, rheumatologic and IBD subjects received a 3-dose schedule with the same intervals as above (the first dose followed by the second and the third doses at 2 and 6 months after the first dose, respectively). Administration of the vaccine was by an experienced immunisation nurse/medical practitioner administered by intramuscular injection (IM), in the deltoid muscle. Immunisation was deferred if the child was febrile (temperature 38 Celsius or above), or if they had an acute illness. Participants were observed for 30 min after vaccination for any immediate adverse reaction. Immune responses were followed to five years post-vaccination, but this study presented the results at 24 months. The last 24 month follow up was completed on 12-OCT-2012. On an unknown date, the subject developed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity. Specimens of the tumour were unavailable to be tested for HPV. The outcome of the event was not reported. The author considered SCC of the oral cavity to be related to the study vaccine. Upon internal review, SCC of the oral cavity was considered to be medically significant event. This is one of the several reports received from the same literature article (cross referenced with MARRS # 1607AUS009740; MARRS # 1607AUS009882; MARRS # 1607AUS010038).

647239-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of hemianopia in a 15-year-old female subject who received Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine + AS04D. On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine + AS04D, the subject developed hemianopia. Serious criteria included GSK medically significant. Additional event(s) included non-epileptic seizure with serious criteria of GSK medically significant, gait disturbance, movements involuntary, memory impairment, prosopagnosia, photophobia, vertigo, hearing impaired and sleep disorder. The outcome of hemianopia was unknown. The outcome(s) of the additional event(s) included non-epileptic seizure (unknown), gait disturbance (unknown), movements involuntary (unknown), memory impairment (unknown), prosopagnosia (unknown), photophobia (unknown), vertigo (unknown), hearing impaired (unknown) and sleep disorder (unknown). It was unknown if the investigator considered the hemianopia, non-epileptic seizure, gait disturbance, movements involuntary, memory impairment, prosopagnosia, photophobia, vertigo, hearing impaired and sleep disorder to be related to Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine + AS04D. In 32 patients with prolonged central nervous system symptoms after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, we measured conventional and immunological markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and compared with the levels in disease controls. Age at 1st vac.: 15.2 years old, Age at last vac.: 15.7 years old. Age at onset: 15.7 years old. Age at examination: 17.6 years old. Suffering: 22.8 months. Our studies revealed significantly decreased chloride and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels in CSF of patients with CNS symptoms after HPV vaccination compared to disease controls, IL-4, IL-13, and CD4+ T cells increased significantly in patients, and IL-17 increased significantly from 12 to 24 months after symptom onset. Chemokines (IL-8 and MCP-1) were also elevated, but CD8+ T cells, PDFG-bb and IL-12 were reduced. Antibodies to GluN2B-NT2, GluN2B-CT and GluN1-NT increased significantly. These results suggest biological, mainly immunological, changes in the CSF of patients after HPV vaccination. The patients had CNS-derived symptoms after vaccination of HPV vaccine, but the causal factors and causal relationship with vaccination have not been proven. It is possible that the heterogeneous diseases developed incidentally after HPV vaccination."

He had further physiotherapy and logopedics, but not yet completely recovered until his discharge on 1/27/2006. He was seen in the out patient clinic on 2/5/2006 because of chest pain. Pneumonia could be ruled out, intercostal neuralgia was suspected and the patient was prescribed diclofenac. Although the vaccinating physician doesn't see any causal relation with the Pneumococcal 23v polysaccharide vaccine, the patient accused that the vaccine is responsible for his illnesses. Apoplexy, fever, polyserositis, chest pain, gastritis erosive, diarrhea and tachycardia were considered to be disabling. Additional information is expected.

277808-1,"It was reported in a published literature article, title as stated above that a child was admitted to the hospital with aseptic 140 days after MMR II (manufacturer unknown) vaccination. Computerized hospital records for children aged 12-23 months (combined annual cohort of approximately 100,000), discharge diagnoses of viral meningitis, mumps, meningitis in other infections classified elsewhere, and meningitis due to other and unspecified causes were identified for the period May 1, 1998, to June 30, 2001, and case notes were reviewed by a pediatrician. The case note review was based on a wider number of codes than just those indicating aseptic meningitis, to ensure that any potentially vaccine-associated case of aseptic meningitis had been identified. Computerized hospital records capture all admissions to hospitals. MMR II, (manufacturer unknown) vaccination histories were independently obtained through linkage with computerized immunization records, using either sex, date of birth, and postcode, a highly specific linking algorithm. Information on batch number was sought for any confirmed aseptic meningitis cases with onset 15-35 days after MMR II (manufacturer unknown) vaccination. The formatting of batch numbers differs substantially between manufacturers in length and alphanumeric coding and is a precise means of distinguishing between vaccines from different manufacturers. In addition, computerized hospital records for children aged 12-23 months, discharge diagnosis of meningitis categorized as mumps, aseptic or viral, were identified for the period January 1, 1991-September 30, 1992, prior to the withdrawal of Urabe-containing MMR II (manufacturer unknown) vaccination histories. Batch numbers were not sought for these cases because Urabe-containing vaccines had comprised approximately 90 percent of the MMR II (manufacturer unknown) vaccine used at the time. Cases of laboratory-confirmed mumps meningitis were also ascertained from reports made for the period from October 1992 to the end of June 2004. For as"

The subject's medical history included varicella. Concurrent vaccination included Prevenar. On 07 June 2007, the subject received unspecified dose of Infanrixquinta (intramuscular, left thigh) (batch number not available) and unspecified dose of Prevenar (right thigh). On 08 June 2007, one day after vaccination with Infanrixquinta, the subject experienced injection site inflammation on the left thigh. The paediatrician prescribed Primalan and alcoholic compress 60 degrees. On 10 June 2007, in view of the extension of the injection site reaction, the subject went to the emergency department. He presented with painful and infiltrated erythema all over the half of the left hemi-thigh and inguinal infracentrimetric adenopathy. The rest of the clinical exam was nothing in particular. Biological results showed chloride at 99mmol/L, C-reactive protein at 15, creatinine at 22, white blood cells at 15.5, haemoglobin at 12.9g/dL, blood potassium at 5.3mmol/L, lymphocytes at 6.450, blood sodium at 141 mmol/L, platelets at 467000, neutrophils at 7.560, protids at 75, urea at 4.8mmol/L and mean corpuscular volume at 76.5.

301172-1,"Around 2 years of age patient had severe gastrointestinal problems (constipation) and severe behavior issues.  We saw no language and bazaar behaviors, sleep problems, PICA (mainly eating paper products and outdoor items, leaves, limbs, dirt, etc.) patient also had 2 heat related seizures while on Augmentin.  He has not had any since taking him off Augmentin.  Patient was put on Miralax for constipation.  He no longer takes this, but he still has some difficulty with stools (sometimes very large). Most of his life until probably the last 6 months we as parents had to make him go to the bathroom to have a bowel movement (we did this every night).  We recently took him off the Miralax and he will usually go by himself without telling him to go.  We have had numerous problems with patient.  Over the years the behaviors have been very severe.  He has broken windows, furniture etc.)  We find it very hard to find people who will work with him because of his behaviors.  A little over 5 years ago we started going to a Defeat Autism Now (DAN) doctor.  We now go to him about once every year or two depending on how patient is doing.  He has put patient on a number of vitamins and supplements and treatments.  Patient seems to be doing better, but we still have outbursts.  Just recently he broke the front window in my Wolkswagen with his hand.   We believe patient has severe headaches.  He is also self abusive (bites his arm and hand).  Hits his head. Over the years patient has been treated by Dr.  He is no longer in practice.  We then went to Dr., Peditrician.  He now practices in a different city, but we still go to him presently.  We also see a Dr.  We have used numerous programs, Speech, Occupational Therapy, Judevine, ABA, Hyperbarics. I am listing some of the doctors who have seen patient over the years.  1/15/08 Reviewed medical records which reveals patient experienced autoimmune disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, encephalopathy, nutritional deficiencies, allergic gastroenteritis/colitis, bed wetting, receptive/expressive language disorder, ADHD, temper tantrums, aggression, constipation, stimming, sleep difficulties, poor interaction w/others, screaming.  Patient tx w/hyperbarics, gluten/caesin free diet, chelation, multiple meds & supplements, NIMH protocol, ST/OT. FINAL DX: autism, pervasive developmental disorder. Per 60 day follow up: He is severly austistic.  Follow-up: Gluten Free/Casein Free diet prescribed by Dr. Vitamins and supplements prescribed by Dr. Previously was on MIRALAX for quite a number of years for constipation. He no longer takes this, but he still has some difficulty with stools (sometimes very large). We feel he was unable to feel when he needed to go to the bathroom for a bowel movement while on MIRALAX, because since he has been off he sometimes goes on his own in the toilet. He never went on his own while on MIRALAX we had to make him go, unless he went on the floor. We make sure he goes at least once a day. Pt is allergic to AUGMENTIN, we found this out after he had two heat related seizures while on this medication when he was younger. Pt also had a hernia operation around 2 years of age. Follow-up: Patient is severely autistic with major deficits in language and social skills. We have seen major behavior problems over the years, but over the last few years we have seen more violent behaviors including kicking and punching out (with his fists) sheet rock walls, glass windows including all 3 window shields in our cars. We continue to see more aggression towards people (parents, caregivers, teachers, students (hitting, punching, biting, kicking). He will never be able to live alone. He will always need a caregiver."

331803-1,"Information has been received from an expert neurologist concerning a male who on an unreported date was vaccinated with a dose of PNEUMOVAX 23.  Within a few hours of the vaccination, the patient developed a painful condition affecting the right arm, also reported as a very painful arm. On an unknown date, the patient saw a neurologist and a MRI scan was performed. According to the reporter, some lesions were clearly shown on MRI scanning in the cervical spine and in the pons as well as in the cerebral hemisphere. The reporter stated that it was not clear from the medical notes that he had access as to what the nature of the neurological damage was but the patient's symptoms were quite florid. The reporter had been asked to comment on this painful condition affecting the right arm that was almost certainly due to demyelination in the central nervous system. He also precised that the pain was probably neuritic in origin. The reporter stated that there was a considerable delay before the patient was seen by a neurologist, and that MRI scanning revealed some central nervous system abnormalities; but listening to the story he suspected that the real problem was an allergic response to the vaccine actually in the brachial plexus of that side. The reporter also stated that the conclusion of the patient's various physicians was that it was an allergic response to PNEUMOVAX 23. It was not reported whether the patient had recovered at the time of this report. Demyelination, allergic reaction, painful arm and neurogenic pain were considered as other important medical events.

On 12 December 1994 and 13 January 1995, the subject received an injection of ENGERIX B, GlaxoSmithKline; intramuscular; batch number not available.  On 24 October 1995 the subject received 3rd dose of ENGERIX B adult (intramuscular, batch number 1760A6).  In 1999, 4 years after vaccination with ENGERIX B adult, the subject experienced lower limb formication.  At the beginning of March 2000, the subject experienced feeling of numbness and formication in lower limbs predominant on the right and spreading out to right lower back associated with feeling of weakness and generalised fatigue.  There was no fever or general state alteration.  Mild distal and proximal right lower limb motor deficit was evidenced.  Deep tendon reflex were sharp, exaggerated in lower limbs with extension of reflex areas.  A right foot exhausting clonus and positive Babinski sign were also reported.  Abdominal reflex were weak but present.  Bilateral dysesthesia for sense of touch on lower limbs predominant on the right, deep sensitivity hypoesthesia (on prick) predominant on the right at the level of D6 and L1 were evidenced on the exam.  Antinuclear antiphospholipids antibody was negative.  C-reactive protein was normal.  Lumbar puncture evidenced 4 leukocyte/mm^3, oligoclonal Ig synthesis (2 kappa IgG), protein level at 0.47g/L with gammaglobulin at 5.6%.  VZV and CMV serology in cerebrospinal fluid was negative.  Blood serologies were negative for CMV and HCV and an old infection for VZV was evidenced.  Encephalic MRI was normal.  Dorso-medullar MRI evidenced myelitis from D4 and D6.  Thoraco-abdominal scan was normal.  Somatosensory evoked potentials were suggestive of central conduction alteration at D12 level.  Auditory evoked potentials evidenced a non specific result.  Visual evoked potentials were normal.  A diagnosis of central nervous system demyelinating disease was suggested.  In May 2000, lower limbs paresthesia worsened with sensory disorder on the left.  On clinical exam muscle strength was normal; reflexes were a little bit sharp on right lower limb, plantar reflex evidenced flexion.  Lower limbs ataxia, both ankles hypopallesthesia, hypoesthesia on the right lower limb which spread out to D6 and on the left lower limb which spread to the groin were also evidenced.  It was also noticed abnormal big toe localizing test and absent abdominal reflex.  Dorsal MRI evidenced new hypersignals between D9 and D10 others hypersignals remained unchanged.  The subject was treated with corticoid and a mild improvement of clinical sign was noticed.  In October 2000, a new episode of worsening of lower limbs paresthesia was reported.  Exam evidenced formication in the palm of the left hand and lower limbs proprioceptive ataxia.  There was no motor deficiency, no superficial sensory disorders, no big toe localizing test abnormality, deep tendon reflex were symmetrical and plantar reflex evidenced flexion.  MRI evidenced persistent intramedullar abnormality (D6-D8) without contrast.  Progressively disorders improved within one month after treatment with corticoids.  In January 2001, the subject initiated treatment with interferon beta.  In 2006, MRI evidenced the same hypersignals as previous ones, there was no significant modification.  Clinical and neurological state of the subject was stable.  The regulatory authority reported that the events were disabling.

A neurologist report dated 13 Jun 2008 stated the patient had a seven month history of her hands going into spasms two to three times per day which last for minutes.  The patient also reported spasms beneath her jaw when yawning and tingling in both hands.  In the first four months of this the patient had constant tingling in the whole leg and hands but that had settled and the patient felt things had slightly improved.  Bladder and bowel function were normal.  Upon examination no abnormality was found, no fasciculations or muscle wasting.  Visual acuity was bilaterally normal with no visual field defects on finger perimetry.  Un-dilated monocular ophthalmoscopy revealed no abnormality of the optic discs, in particular there was no nystagmus, no gaze palsy, no diplopia, no saccadic break up of pursuit normal cranial nerve V, VIII through XII function.  The patient had normal muscle tone, bilaterally normal tendon reflexes, no manifest or latent paresis in any limb, with normal toe walk, heel walk, arm holding and finger strength.  Coordination and balance were well preserved.  No sensory deficit for touch, pain or temperature.  The spinal column was not undult tender to percussion, normal spinal mobility.  The patient's son was diagnosed with idiopathic paroxysmal kinesogenic dyskinesia in 2006 however the neurologist did not think the patient's symptoms were akin to her son's problems.  There was no evidence for structural pathology in particular not for transverse myelitis.  The neurologist described the patient's problem as a proneness to cramp.  For pragmatic management the patient was advised to re-breathe into a rolled up newspaper to cater for the off chance of over-breathing which the patient denies, and the patient was recommended to try magnesium supplements as symptomatic treatment.  A neurologist report dated Apr 2009 stated the patient told the doctor that the problems started in 2006 and 2007 with discomfort in her feet and legs and very bad tingling after the flu jab.  In 2007, she had numbness in her left leg which lasted for about a week and spasms in her feet that felt swollen and puffy.  She was examined at the casualty department and no explanation was found and she was told to rest.  It was difficult for the patient to lift her legs over little obstacles and had balance problems and ringing in the ears and eye problems.  In 2008 and 2009, she developed headaches, sometimes pain in the eyes, twitching in the legs, stiffness in the legs, burning sensations in her muscles, general tiredness, tingling and sometimes trembling, occasional blurred vision and clumsiness, feeling in coordinated, with poor memory and hearing.  Upon examination by a neurologist in Apr 2009, the neurologist saw the patient walk rather tentatively but with no manifest or latent paresis or ataxia.  Tendo"
422001-1,"Case received from the Health Authorities in a foreign country under the reference number NT20110219. Case medically confirmed. A 14-year-old female patient had received the three doses of GARDASIL (batch number not reported) in December 2009, February 2010 and April 2010, and a dose of ENGERIX B (other manufacturer) on an unspecified date. In April, she developed ecchymosis increasingly marked and an increasing asthenia which led to a biological work-up. On 22-MAY-2010, blood count and differential white count revealed a thrombocytopenia at 26000 platelets with Hemoglobin at 13g/dl, white blood cells at 5000 with 80% PNN, 0% eosinophils. The patient was hospitalized on 04-JUN-2010. There was no hepatomegaly nor splenomegaly. Biological work-up showed white blood cells at 4660/mm3, slight lymphopenia at 671/mm3, thrombocytopenia with platelets at 39000, Hb at 13g/dl. pap smear did not show any schistocytes. Electrolyte pattern and hepatic transaminases were normal. Immunoglobulins were normal with IgG at 9.9 g/l, IgA 1.78 g/l and IgM 1.48 g/l. Viral serologies HIV, C hepatitis and CMV were negative. Hepatitis B serology showed vaccinal immunization and EBV showed a former primary infection. Antinuclear factors, anticardiolipins factors and antiphospholipids were negative. Complement dosage was negative. Differential bone marrow count performed on 10-JUN-2010 showed a polymorphous bone marrow, with an megakaryocytic line and fonctional aspect suggesting a peripheral origin. Diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was suspected. To be noted a possible photosensitivity with erythema of the lower limbs at the end of August 2010. A treatment by corticotherapy was started in May 2010 which enabled an improvement of the platelets count from 26000 to 70000 in May then after a fall in July from 13000 to 58000. The medical follow-up in 2011 was ongoing. AT the time of reporting, the patient had not recovered. To be noted that the patient had no relevant medical history, and that her mother had had a thrombotic microangiopathy with renal impairment. The Health Authorities assessed the causal relationship between the reported reactions and vaccinations with both GARDASIL and ENGERIX B as doubtful (C1 S2 I1) according to the foreign method of assessment. Other business partner numbers include E2011-02486."
423104-1,"Information has been received from a registered nurse concerning her 32 month old healthy and strong son with no drug allergies who on 11-JUL-2000 was vaccinated with a dose of VARIVAX (Merck) (lot number and route of administration not reported). The nurse reported that her son developed 3-4 chicken pox lesions several days after he received VARIVAX (Merck). The nurse also reported that her son began to ""dig at"" his left forearm after he received VARIVAX (Merck) and he often caused his forearm to bleed. The nurse reported that her son continued to scratch and ""dig at"" his left forearm until her son was 9 years old. Nurse believed this was caused by post herpetic neuralgia. The nurse also reported a second son who experienced an adverse event following vaccination with VARIVAX (Merck) (WAES1103USA01246). On 11-FEB-2011 the patient developed chicken pox again with lesions on both sides of his body, he was almost recovered from his lesion when he ""dropped"" and had a seizure. At the time of the report, the patient has had seizures for the past 2 weeks, over 20 seizures per day, they were not convulsive and not epileptic seizures (no electrical activity). His eyes rolled back, he became limp, his upper body jerked and his eyes fluttered. The patient was partially aware and had some memory of his seizures. The patient had been in the emergency room 5 times and the patient was hospitalized for 2 days. The hospital physicians did not think he was having seizures, but the nurse who was reporting this about her son thought he was having seizures. He was treated in the hospital with fluids. The patient's cerebral spinal fluid pressure was high and he had increased protein in his cerebral spinal fluid, his lymph nodes behind his right ear were grossly enlarged and behind his left ear were mildly enlarged. The nurse gave her son vitamins (unspecified), ZYRTEC, BENADRYL and ""citrus"". Her son developed 4 new lesions recently and when that happened his seizures increased and his lymph nodes enlarged again. He had one lesion on his forearm surrounded by what looked like cellulitis. The nurse applied ice and charcoal poultice. The cellulitis was gone later that evening. A week ago (approximately 28-Feb-2011) the patient's left lower leg had ""flames of fire"" going up his blood vessels on his shin and her son said it felt numb in that area. The redness and numbness were gone a day later (approximately 01-March-2011). Yesterday on 06-March-2011, the patient had ""flames of fire"" on the top of his left thigh. Follow-up information was received via e-mail from the nurse indicating that her son's CSF sample was sent to a lab. The nurse stated that on 16-MAR-2011, her son had a new spot and there was one on his chest that was just developing a small pustule. These spots were much smaller and very latent in his progression of disease so she was not sure if the lesions would be any good. The nurse mentioned that she had an appointment to collect a specimen off one or both of these. Follow-up information was received via telephone call from the registered nurse concerning her son who lived for 7 years with his grandfather who had chronic shingles in 2002 and 2004 and was treated with acyclovir, but had been fairly stable since then. The patient's grandfather not live in the same house with them but rather live in a separate house but were constantly in and out their home. The patient had regular and close contact with him. The registered nurse stated that her son, prior to vaccination with VARIVAX (Merck), was a normal, healthy child with no significant medical history. In July 2000, her son developed 3-4 varicella like lesions post vaccination with VARIVAX (Merck), from which recovered. However, several weeks post vaccination with VARIVAX (Merck), and after the lesions resolved, her son started to ""dig"" and scratch at an area on his left forearm. This continued off and on until he was about 9 years old. When the registered nurse asked why her son contin"

On 30 July 2011, less than one day after vaccination with CERVARIX, the subject experienced syncope. The physician considered the event was clinically significant (or requiring intervention). On 30 July 2011, the event was resolved. Follow-up information received on 19 August 2011: No predisposing factor was reported. The subject did not have the following family history on her own medical history: heart disorder, epilepsy, metabolic abnormality (such as diabetes mellitus), allergy (such as vaccine induced allergy, vaccine components induced allergy, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, eczema, or asthma). The subject had no past medical history of loss of consciousness. No concomitant medication was reported. The subject was in a sitting position when she experienced the events. It was reported the absence of painful/emotional stimulus before the onset of the event. But the subject had the following precipitating event: Fear. The absence of a sign or warning for the episode was reported. The subject did not sweat before the event and did not feel warmth. The events developed suddenly. On 30 July 2011, the subject experienced collapse, loss of consciousness for a few seconds and slightly pale. The subject was treated with Solita T No. 3 (maintenance solution, 200 mL) and fluid replacement. No abnormality was observed in the respiratory pattern and in the motion. The subject did not experience tongue biting. The subject recovered in the supine position. Blood pressure was 98/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 48 beats/minute and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SP02) was 97% immediately after the onset of events. No symptom developed after recovery from the loss of consciousness. The subject did not remember anything about being unconsciousness. No particular examination was performed. The events did not recur. The reporter considered the events were related to vaccination with CERVARIX."
436316-1,"This literature report (initial receipt: 20-Sep-2011) concerns 2245 patients aged between 15 to 83 years who received TIV at a participating public hospital. Of these, the mean age was 45.9 years, 1775 (79.1%) were female and 470 (20.9%) were male. The majority were employees of the hospital section (2016, 89.8%). The predominant occupations were hospital-based nurses and midwives (717, 31.9%), allied health professionals (396, 17.6%), patient support services (174, 7.8%), doctors (139, 6.2%) and administrative and other site staff (357, 15.9%). The remaining respondents worked in community health, affiliated laboratories, or were students or hospital volunteers. The majority had received TIV in the past (1933, 86.1%) and 1002 (44.6%) had received the PANVAX. Most patients received FLUVAX (2019, 89.9%), 26 (10.1%) received another brand (VAXIGRIP 201, 9.0%; INFLUVAC 25, 1.1%). Within 48 hours after receipt of TIV side effects were reported by 387 (17.2%) patients. Some of the patients experienced multiple side effects. Of the 2019 patients who received FLUVAX, 229 had soreness at site, 98 had swelling at site, 90 had redness at site, 84 had flu-like illness, 51 had fever, 79 had headache, 52 had sore throat, 42 had runny nose, 115 experienced fatigue, 3 had generalised rash, 20 had local rash, 2 had facial swelling, 18 fainted, 36 had joint pains, 77 had muscle aches, 14 had nausea/vomiting. The patients were not individually identifiable. Thirty patients (29 of whom received FLUVAX) had to seek health advice following a side effect temporally related to the receipt of TIV; most consulted a doctor (15) or a nurse (13). Ten (all were FLUVAX recipients) needed treatment, though only one of these required hospital management. Four (all had received FLUVAX) indicated that their side effect(s) was reported to the Department of Health or the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Several did not know whether or not this had occurred. Most patients (1621, 72.2%) did not experience an ILI (influenza like illness) resulting in absenteeism during the 2010 influenza season. The remainder reported one (449, 20.0%), two or three (146, 6.5%) or more than three (22, 1.0%) episodes of ILI resulting in work absence. The patient outcome was not reported. Reporter's comment: Overall, the influenza vaccine was demonstrated to be safe among this large sample of predominantly healthcare workers. However, in this cohort, FLUVAX was associated with a higher risk of side effects (albeit predominantly mild) compared with other brands of influenza vaccine available in the market in 2010. The difference in the side effect profiles was largely confined to systemic effects. In that year, the brand was also associated with an increased risk of febrile events in children aged under 9 years."

Worked in yard weeding and chopping wood for fireplace to work out stiffness and distract self from headache. Saturday, 09/15/2012 7:00 AM Awoke with slight headache and more stiffness. Took another OTC ibuprofen. 3:30 PM While driving home from luncheon, felt increasing stiffness creeping across right shoulder to the base of my skull. Took another OTC ibuprofen and worked again in yard. 7:00 PM When I got up from watching TV to go to kitchen, felt an explosion in my head. Felt like two rivers of lava/pain were creeping up my head from base of skull to crown, which felt tender to the touch like that of a newborn baby's soft skull. Also felt as if a bottle of Coca Cola had been poured into my head and every burst of the bubbles sent new pain to my head. Thought I might have had an aneurysm. Went immediately to bed, but found it difficult to get into bed and lie down as couldn't position head without fierce pain. Felt like blocks of my brain were shifting about in great pain. Hard to get out of bed, too. When standing up, finally, felt like I would keel over if I put my head back or to either side and would pass out if I put my chin to my chest. Spent restless night but did get about 2 hours of sleep. Sunday, 09/16/2012, 12 Noon Pain was 50% gone. So I did not go to Emergency Room. Took more OTC ibuprofen figuring pain would be gone by evening. Worked again in yard. Monday, 09/17/2012, 7:00PM Had repetition of pain on Saturday night. Took OTC ibuprofen and went to bed. Tuesday 11;00 AM I had appointment for a mammogram and fasting blood work at facility closer to my home. Had mammogram done although receptionist could see that I was in pain. Tried to get my doctor on the phone, but number was wrong in the directory. I tried to spell last name but not in the directory. Went next door to get blood work done, but while waiting to be called, fluorescent lights sent daggers of pain into my eyes. 12:15 PM Took back my prescription, got into my car and drove down to my doctor's office. Had fasting blood work done on 1st floor and then went up to 7th floor to find my doctor. By time I got off elevator, I was in tears from the pain. 12:45 PM Receptionist informed me that Dr. was not in that day, but that another Dr. would see me. He and a colleague examined me but could not find nothing wrong other than my description of the pain and that my eyes jumped sometimes when following his finger up and down, right and left. They thought I might have a mild form of meningitis or West Nile Disease and said they wanted to order a lumbar puncture. They gave me a small can of apple juice and 6 graham cookies to assuage my hunger and had me wheeled to the Emergency Room. Took HCTZ, Vitamin D & Baby Aspirin. 1:30 PM Arrived at ER. 6:30 PM Finally saw doctor on duty. Pain was nearly gone. 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM Had non-fasting blood test done, a urine analysis and a CAT scan. All were normal and unremarkable. Pain nearly gone except neck stiffness on right. 10:00 PM Doctor still wanted me to have lumbar puncture. However, since the possible side effects were horrendous (possible infection at the puncture, neurological damage, and/or month-long headache, and they couldn't tell me what finding blood in the spinal fluid would indicate other than a possible small blood vessel bursting deep in my brain which wasn't captured on CAT scan, I refused. They also couldn't tell me what the diagnosis and  treatment would be. 11:30 PM Discharge ""against all medical advice"" and given prescriptions for 600 mg of ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant. Advised that I could fly the following week - 09/26/2012 to 10/01/2012. Saturday, 09/29/2012 Out of state and fully recovered. Monday, 10/01/2012 Flew home and have had no symptoms since."

A 17 months male patient, with no medical history reported, was vaccinated on 08-APR-09 with a first dose of MMRVAXPRO (batch number NK00730, 662861/1373X expiry date 19-DEC-2011, also reported as 30-SEP-2010) i.m. in the right thigh and with a first dose of MENJUGATE (batch number 199011, expiry date 30-SEP-10) i.m. in the left thigh and on 16-APR-09, the patient experienced papular lesion on the face and the left cheekbone, flushed with a tendency to expansion to the trunk and face. A section of skin presented parakeratosis, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, interstitial and periadnexal abundant with granulomatous appearance mainly due to hair follicles, consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes, some plasma cells and rare eosinophils. The HA decided to code it as ""maculopapular rash"". On 08-MAY-09, a diagnosis of nummular lesions of the trunk with suspected pityriasis rosea Gilbert was done. A topical treatment was prescribed. On 24-JUN-09, following the worsening of clinical condition with evolution of successive crops, histological examination of abdomen was performed. On an unspecified date, pityriasis lichenoides and acute varioliform was evocated although histological appearance at the examination of the biopsy was not really typical, given the presence of histiocytes particularly important and the absence of keratinocytic necrosis and hematic extravasations. Since the beginning of SEP-09, clinical condition evolved and healing of skin lesions was observed. On 11-JUL-13, the patient received an injection of tetanus toxoid vaccine (manufacturer unknown) and had no adverse event. At the time of reporting, the patient had recovered with sequelae. The agency considered that case serious due to be medically significant. The case is closed."

538972-1,"This medically confirmed literature report (initial receipt 22-Jul-2014) concerns a 39-year-old male. On an unknown date, the patient received Influenza virus vaccine (manufacturer and batch number not provided). On an unknown date, immediately following influenza vaccination, the patient developed left shoulder pain. On an unknown date, two months following the vaccination, the patient presented at the clinic with prolonged, increasing left shoulder pain. The physical examination was normal. On laboratory assessment, leukopenia was noted on CBC (3-4,700 on serial tests for 4 months) without defined source, although counts were otherwise normal. ESR was normal. BMI was recorded as 25.7 kg/m2. The MRI of the shoulder was performed three months following vaccination. It showed Magnetic resonance imaging showed oblique coronal image and oblique sagittal fat-saturated T2 weighted image which showed focal subcortical bone marrow edema-like signal within the greater tuberosity, without associated obvious cortical destruction. The subcutaneous fat thickness was measured to be 4.7 mm on oblique coronal T1-weighted sequences. Hyperintense T2 signal along the periosteum indicated periosteal reaction. There were periosseous soft tissue inflammatory changes and small subacromial/subdeltoid bursal fluid. Laboratory testing did not support any infectious etiology. The patient was not actively anti-coagulated. Sagittal T1-weighted imaging showed hypointense bone marrow signal. The patient was treated conservatively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for 2 weeks and had complete resolution of symptoms after 5.5 months of observation. Outcome was reported as recovered. Authors comment: A causal relationship between vaccine administration and deltoid bursitis has been formally established. It has been reported that unintentional injection of vaccine antigen into subacromial/subdeltoid bursa can trigger an inflammatory reaction. Due to variable body habitus and muscle size, the optimum point for vaccine injection may vary among individuals. An improper angle of approach of the needle or increased needle length may result in bursal or cortical penetration, particularly in those with low BMI."
540875-1,"Within 12-48 hrs I experienced the following ailments. I am not a Dr. I do not know which are from the vaccine and which may be from childbirth. Additionally this list only covers things I was not experiencing immediately prior to vaccination or were unique to the situation: -ringing in ears -blurred vision -headache (not migraine) -severely swollen feet -congestion/respiratory problems -itching all over body -eczema/acne -raised white spots on lips -burning sensation in feet (peripheral nerve damage) -jaw/neck/throat pain Vaccines were given after delivering my child. Easy pregnancy. Full term child. Was induced a couple days early due to my blood pressure being a little high and because my dr said she would be out of town on his due date. Was GBS positive and given antibiotics during labor. Epidural catheter was placed 3 times but test dose was ineffective. There was no time for pain medication during delivery. An hr or less after he was born I was walking around (with escorts) and then moved to a new room. Everything was fine. When it was time to leave it was strongly suggested I be vaccinated for Pneumonia, TDap, and Flu. I fought with them and 100% denied the Flu vaccine as both times in the past I took it I was diagnosed with the flu within 24-48 hrs following. I allowed the Pneumococcal vaccine. I DO NOT know which manufacturer it was. I also allowed the TDaP vaccine. I was told they were very important due to my history of asthma and since I was breast feeding to pass immunity to my son. The nurse still showed up with and almost gave me the flu vaccine even though I did not sign for it. I had to send her out to recheck which ones I'd agreed to."

October 6, 2015 Can not move left arm, very painful, can barely walk, left leg does not seem to work well, almost fell on way to bathroom. Felt as if I has no control of the movements of the left side of my body. No change for 7 days as I spent all the time in a recliner. October 14, 2015 Can now lift my left arm approximately 6 inches, left leg is beginning to work but does not synchronize with my right leg while trying to walk. Soles of feet have stinging sensations constantly and skin feels as if it is being poked with needles. My right side is starting to respond similarly to my left side. My arms feel as if they are asleep for a couple hours at a time. Sometimes hands and feet will tingle for an hour or so. I have no sensation in my fingertips, I can not feel things. My fingernails have broken to the quick and are not growing. October 30, 2015 I can lift my arms high enough to put on shirts, but is very painful. My left arm hurts constantly. Nov. 11, 2015 My legs seem to work together  a little better. There have been two instances when everything seemed to be working fairly well and without ant warning both legs just seemed almost paralyzed. One time I was at market and did not think I could get to my car in the parking lot. This frightened me so much that I now carry a folding cane at all times. Nov. 16, 2015 I had a dr. appointment today. The dr. had an intern student on staff that day. She was sent in to see me. I was in terrible condition and I told her about all of my symptoms. She talked with me for about 30 minutes. She recorded all of the information into the computer. The dr. entered the room and stated that this was going to be a short visit- Do you need any medication refills? He did not examine me, I question his examination report for that day. Nov. 22, 2015 I am now having bladder problems. I can not keep my urine stream going. It is difficult to start urinating, and then the flow stops, sometimes I start and stop urinating 9-10 times before I can empty my bladder. This occurs event if  my bladder seems very full. I have never had this problem previously and I have not had any medication changes. It is a struggle to ensure that I get my bladder empty. Today I went to the bathroom, when I pulled down my pants I was surprised to discover that I had soiled my pants. It was very runny, I had not passed gas, I did not know it had happened. Now I fear it will happen when  I am not home. Dec. 6, 2015 I think I have a bladder infection, but a trip to the dr. and a urine test does not indicate an infection. Even though I have had muscular pain for a few years, all of the new pains are completely different. I hope these new pains recede soon as I just seem to be getting weak and do not seem to be seeing any improvement. I have started physical therapy, trying to improve my legs. Jan. 6, 2016 I had an MRI today, to check for any physical reason that my bladder does not work correctly. Nothing was identified on the MRI."
648192-1,"Initial unsolicited report received from the literature on 29 July 2016. This case is linked to LINKED CASES 2016SA140381, 2016SA140455, 2016SA140480, 2016SA140494, 2016SA140516, 2016SA140962, 2016SA140980, 2016SA140990, 2016SA141005, 2016SA141097, 2016SA141105 (same literature). The following is verbatim from the article: Abstract: Background: No comparative review of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) submissions following pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 and seasonal influenza vaccinations during the pandemic season has been published. Methods: We compared different adverse event reporting rates. Adverse events (AEs) following vaccination were identified from VAERS for adults aged 17-44 years after pandemic (monovalent influenza [MIV], and seasonal (trivalent inactivated influenza [IIV3], live attenuated influenza [LAIV3]) vaccines. Results: Vaccination coverage was more than four times higher for MIV and more than twenty times higher for LAIV3 in the one population versus the other population. The reporting rate of serious AE reports following MIV in the first population (1.19 per 100,000) was about half that reported by the second population (2.45 per 100,000). Conversely, the rate of serious AE reports following LAIV3 among the first population (1.32 per 100,000) was more than twice that of the second population. Although fewer AEs among the first population following MIV were reported overall, the rate of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) (4.01 per million) was four times greater than that in the second population. (1.04 per million). Conclusions: Despite higher vaccination coverage in the first population, the rate of serious AEs following MIV was about half that in the second population. The rate of GBS reported following MIV was higher in the first population. This case involves a 39 year old male patient who was vaccinated with a dose of Monovalent H1N1 Vaccine (batch number, dose, route and site of administration was not reported) on an unspecified date. The patient had medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Illness/ other in four weeks prior to onset of GBS symptoms included: Clostridium Difficile infection (detected as inpatient). Concomitant medications were reported as insulin pump. On an unspecified date, two days following vaccination, patient had Paresthesias (whole body) and cramps in legs, and patient was diagnosed with ""Sensory GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome)"" (4) vs. small fiber neuropathy (neurologist's diagnosis). Lab data included electromyography: normal exam, brain scan MRI of cervical spine was also performed (results not reported). Patient received supportive treatment. Outcome of events was not reported. Upon internal review, the company decided to consider the event as serious because of important medical event: Guillain-Barre syndrome and small fiber neuropathy. Documents held by sender: none. Sender's Comments: This is a case of a patient who received MONOVALENT INFLUENZA A/H1N1 PRESERVATIVE VACCINE and experienced Guillain-Barre syndrome and suspected small fiber neuropathy. Patient is a known case of diabetes mellitus. Additional information regarding relevant medical history, clinical details surrounding the events, investigation results confirming the diagnosis, concomitant medications, if any and concurrent conditions, if any are needed for complete assessment of the case."

These events were not reported as adverse events due to vaccine administration, but were found during the course of review of the vaccinee's medical records. Therefore, they are not listed as adverse events. Subsequent to receiving the second dose of Lymerix, the pt began to experience arthralgia and myalgia involving the heel, knee and lower back. He sought medical treatment. The physician prescribed Celebrex and physical therapy. The pt was switched from Celebrex to Vioxx. The pt was again seen by the physician at which time he continued to have arthralgia and myalgia affecting the thoracic vertebrae, lower back, both shoulders and the left knee.

193281-1,"I was dizzy about five minutes after the shot, and the dizzyness increased through the day.  When active or eating, the dizzyness went away a little.  When I went to bed at night, as I began to relax more, the room began to spin.  I could not take my medication - Prilosec - before I ate in the evening, because I was afraid that it would make me more dizzy.  I could not drive in the evening.  Also, the pain I suffer in the rest of my abdomen from chronic endometriosis increased greatly.  My abdomen swelled, making my clothing tight at the waist.  This was not because I had skipped taking the Prilosec, because this occured in a different part of the abdomen.  Due to recent endometriosis symptoms (prior to this vaccine), I have been eating less, and my clothing has been loose at the waist, before yesterday.  Even though endometriosis is a condition that I usually must deal with, I need to know just how vaccinations affect it.  I had the flu last spring, and my internist had strongly suggested that I get a flu shot this year, but I am not sure if my endometriosis will increase.  I also suffer from chronic excema problems, but today, my entire face is red and itchy, much more than usual.  I am less dizzy today.  However, my abdomen is still more swollen than usual.  I am seeing my gynecologist tomorrow.  I have had no other vaccines recently.  I have had recent abdominal pain, probably due to a return of endometriosis, but adding stress from any source can cause further problems.  Stress increases hormone levels, which increase the growth of endometriosis tissue at locations where it should not be.  Although I am most concerned about the abdominal stress, I am also concerned about the dizzyness, and I do not know the source of that."

Around 5pm she didn't seem as alert as usual and she seemed a little pale. I didn't think too much about it. Then at 5:20-5:30pm, my dad was holding her and she raised her lets up and made three groans like I never heard before and I knew something was wrong. I went to get her and she was extremely pale, she was clammy, and her head was wet. She didn't have a fever. She was lethargic and above her lip began to turn blue. She seemed as if she was ready to lose consciousness. I was afraid for her life and the thought did cross my mind that I was going to have to do CPR. I called the doctors office immediately. 10-15 minutes passed and she seemed to be coming around. I called the office back because no one returned my call. I did tell them at that point that she was coming around, but I still needed to talk to the Doctor on call. Doctor returned my call around 5:50-5:55pm. At this point, patient seemed like herself again and she nursed fine. By 6:30pm I gave her another dose of Tylenol, her coloring was back to normal and she was smiling again etc. I was told to watch her through the evening and call doctor back in the am.

As he had an excoriation of the crest of the right tibia, he was administered a dose of tetanus toxoid vaccine. Upon admission, the medical team reported a massive and global right hemiplegia with a non fluctuating aphasia and a fluctuating vigilance: a cerebral scanner performed showed no bleeding but sequelaes from deep left sylvian ischemia. 24 hours after his admission, the patient was transferred to neurologia for sylvian infarct confirmed by encephalic MRI. He was prescribed heparin and antibiotics therapy. 72 hours after the vaccination, the patient developed in a few hours a flaccid areflexive tetraparesia with axial attack, facial diplegia, hypophonia and deglutition disorder, but without dysautonomic disorder. The plantar reflex stayed in extension on the right side. The medullar MRI was normal. CPK were normal. The EMG concluded that it was a severe neurogenic axonal attack of four limbs with spontaneous activity at rest composed by slow motion waves and fibrillary potentials leading to a compatible denervation with neuropathy. The evolution was favorable allowing the patient to be put on a wheel chair and to feed orally progressively in 5 weeks. Two months later, the axial and left hemicorporal motor deficiency had mainly regressed by the right hemiparesia persisted. The patient presented then with a shift syndrome still. He died at home one year later. Case is closed."

Additional therapy as of 10-AUG-2007 included calcium (unspecified), chondroitin sulfate sodium (+) glucosamine sulfate, CENTRUM, aspirin, VAGIFEM, cefaclor, MONUROL, rizatriptan benzoate (MSD), hydrocodone bitartrate, alendronate sodium (MSD) and LOPRESSOR. It was noted that as far as the physician knew, the patient does not have any history of being immunocomprised so he is going to check some basic lab work such as cell counts and things like these just to make sure nothing funny is going on. Lab studies were performed with abnormal results of WBC 11.3, Granulocyte % 78, Absolute Granulocyte of 8.8 and Absolute Monocyte of 1.1. The patient was recovering. There was no further information provided. No product quality complaint was involved. Additional information has been requested."
301804-1,"This case was reported by a lawyer via a statement of injuries and described the occurrence of muscle aches in a female subject of unspecified age who was vaccinated with LYMErix for prophylaxis. A physician or other health care professional has not verified this report. On an unspecified date the subject received unspecified dose of Lymerix (unknown). At an unspecified time after vaccination with Lymerix, the subject experienced muscle aches, liver disorders, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, headaches, ""possible"" memory loss, and decreased activities of daily living. Additionally, the subject experienced ""rheumatologic, neurologic, and/or cognitive impairment of an autoimmune, immune-mediated, or other mechanism. At the time of reporting the outcome of the events was unspecified. Follow up information was received on 27 December 2007 via medical records. Medical history included two past episodes of Lyme disease, glaucoma, cataract surgery, atrial trigeminy and sinus arrhythmia, as well as dizzy spells beginning in approximately 1999. In September 1999 and/or November 1999, she experienced a tick bite with a surrounding inflammatory reaction and rash, and was treated with a two week course of amoxicillin. She was reportedly advised that Lyme disease and Ehrlichiosis were excluded. In late November 1999, she developed fatigue. Alanine aminotransferase was approximately 1400 U/L at that time, and aspirate aminotransferase was over 700 U/L. Several weeks after completing amoxicillin therapy, she developed an itchy body rash felt to be allergic dermatitis, and was treated with cortisone injection and a course of doxycylline for Lyme disease. Aminotransferase values were reportedly elevated until mid-January 2000 (ALT approximately 189 and AST approximately 130). Acute viral hepatitis serologies were negative. In early 2000 she presented with hepatitis determined to be autoimmune in nature, and a biopsy on 24 March 2000 revealed hepatitis with fibrosis/early cirrhosis. Prednisone therapy was initiated.

Exam 2/6/08 revealed trophic changes to right side of tongue w/white spots.  Referred to ENT. Follow-up: The family, including patient, feel her physical condition is directly related to the vaccine. The neurologist diagnosed patient with ALS but did not commit to a ""yes"" or ""no"" if this resulted from the vaccine. Her symptoms began shortly after being vaccinated. She can no longer raised her hands and arms, unable to walk, cannot feed herself, etc. She now is losing her ability to talk. The neurologist now admits that some of her symptoms are not typical of ALS.  I am the mother of patient responding to your inquiry. I am enclosing a copy of patient's journal as her physical problems have progressively gotten worse. She has been seen by two neurologist and after a battery of tests, MRIs of her whole body, EEG, EMG, CAT scans, blood work etc they have ruled out anything else and have come up with the diagnosis of ALS, aka Lou Gehrigs disease. We have pointedly asked the doctors if it could have resulted from her flu vaccine they were uncommitted. She had never had flu shot before as she has had a very active immune system since childhood and could not tolerance many meds. She is an RN and worked and was in an urgent care clinic. At the urging of her manager she conceded to get the progressed at an alarming rate. She has been unable to work since January and is now on Social Security disability. We definitely feel this is the result of the flu shot which was resulted in her immune system going into overdrive. We are not looking for any monetary compensation but would like this reaction to be explored further and see if there is some medical solution that would result in her getting better. She can no longer care for herself and needs 24 hour care. The prognosis is not good. Although most ALS patients are given 2-6 years of life and many live to 20 years after diagnosis patient has deteriorated this much in 4 months. Thanks for your continued interest in this matter. We would be thankful for anything you could offer in medical advice as to a solution or relief in her situation.

On 14-APR-2008, the patient was seen by the physician complaining of persistent left arm tenderness at the injection site in January. Initially the patient noticed bruising as well as redness and warmth. Those symptoms resolved within a week or so. Although the tenderness improved the patient continued to experience tenderness when she laid on her left side or when she abducted her shoulder. An exam of the left shoulder showed no swelling or deformity. No erythema. There was fairly localized tenderness over the deltoid muscle about 3 or cm distal to the shoulder joint. The shoulder itself was non-tender to palpation. Full range of motion of the left shoulder with discomfort with internal rotation. Muscle strength was normal in upper extremity. Deep tendon reflexes were 2 plus and symmetrical in upper extremities. Assessment: Tenderness, left upper arm. The physician noted she could not be absolutely sure this is related to the injection.

333618-1,"It was reported in a published literature article, titled as stated above that an 18 year old male with a history of acute myeloid leukaemia was vaccinated on an unspecified date with PNEUMOVAX 23 (manufacturer unknown). It was noted that this 18-year-old man with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia presented for neurological consultation with a 1-month history of headaches. The headaches were described had increased in frequency and severity during the 10 days before presentation, and were associated with episodes of transient, self-limited, binocular loss of vision. The headaches did not correlate with time of day, did not awaken from sleep, and were unaffected by changes in body position. He denied photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, or scintillating auras. The pain improved slightly with acetaminophen. A thorough review of the signs were remarkable only for mild neck pain, intermittent lightheadedness, and dizziness. His past medical history was remarkable for acute myelogenous leukemia in the background of monosomy 7-associated myelodysplastic syndrome. His initial presentation at age 15 years was accompanied by syncope and pancytopenia (white blood cells, 2,900/cc3; hemoglobin, 5 g/dL; platelets, 15,000/cc3). Analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid at the time of his original diagnosis produced normal results. He was treated initially with systemic cytarabine, daunorubicin, etoposide, and intrathecal infusions of Methotrexate and cytarabine. He then underwent a 6/6 matched, unrelated-donor bone marrow transplant, after receiving total body radiation (total dose, 1,440 cGy) and cyclophosphamide as pretransplant conditioning. He engrafted without difficulty, and exhibited only mild, self-limited, oral chronic graft-versus-host disease that did not require systemic therapy. Three years after transplantation, during an evaluation for causes of recurrent sinusitis, mild immunodeficiency was diagnosed, based on a poor specific antibody response to PNEUMOVAX 23. As a result, the patient had been receiving monthly intravenous gamma globulin. He had also experienced episodes of lightheadedness, 2 years before the current presentation, at which time he underwent a neurologic examination, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, lumbar puncture, and electroencephalogram, all of which produced normal results. He had mild adjustment issues related to his underlying illness. The patient denied the use of caffeine, illicit drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. Medications included nasal fluticasone, topical tretinoin, and acetaminophen. His family was remarkable for a distant history of migraines and several relatives with solid-organ cancer. On examination, the patient was afebrile, with normal blood pressure. He was in no distress, without neck tenderness or meningismus. A general examination was notable only for mild, healing acne vulgaris. On neurologic assessment, his mental status was entirely intact. The visual fields in each eye exhibited full to double simultaneous quadratic confrontation. His pupils were equal, round, and reactive to both light and dark. His visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. There was no relative efferent papillary defect. A fundoscopic examination demonstrated bilateral papilledema with associated retinal hemorrhage. There were no extudes, and the retinal vasculature appeared normal. Venous pulsations were not observed. A slit-lamp examination of the anterior and poster chambers and intraocular pressure produced normal results. Sensory, motor, and cerebellar examinations produced normal results. His deep-tendon reflexes were symmetric and normal, without spread or clonus. His plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. The initial evaluation included normal results of magnetic resonance imaging, a magnetic resonance angiogram, and a magnetic resonance venogram of the brain, performed without the use of intravenous contrast.

A 61-year-old female subject who had a history of hypertension, a motor vehicle accident in May 2006 and low back pain, had received an injection of ADACEL, lot number C2341AA on 24 July 2006 and 25 days later, she had an emergency visit due to acute onset lower extremity weakness which was subsequently diagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome. She was hospitalized from 18 August until 25 August 2006, then discharged to a skilled nursing facility for rehabilitation. According to medical records, the subject was involved in a motor vehicle accident in May 2006 and developed some low back pain. She received Flexeril and Etodolac with resolution of the pain and subsequently stopped those medications. She also experienced two mechanical falls in the mean time, ""none related last month"", and had no sequelae. Thereafter she was able to get up and walk around. On the day of hospital admission, the subject noted some mild lower back pain while trying to get up and go to the bathroom. When she tried to stand up, she noticed that her legs were weak with some tingling, and she was unable to walk. Both feet felt numb and were very weak in both lower extremities. She had no family history of diabetes and no known drug allergies. Outpatient medications were Atenolol 25 mg, Calcium and Vitamin D supplements and Glucosamine. Emergency room examination findings: blood pressure 170/80, Saturation 98% (room air), and heart rate in 70s. Neurological findings: alert and oriented x4, cranial nerves intact with 5/5 bilateral upper extremity strength. Lower extremity hip flexors were about 3/5 with some breakaway weakness; ankles and toes were 3/5 with decreased sensation in the distribution of socks in the dorsal and plantar aspect of the feet. The remainder of physical examination findings were normal. Lab data was unremarkable. On 18 August 2006, radiologic imaging noted L/Spine mild degenerative joint disease. CT of the head was negative. MRI (thoracolumbar) showed normal spine, no compression, no fracture or subluxation, alignment normal; there was however some mild multilevel disc disease without any spinal stenosis and some mild neuroforaminal narrowing at L4-L5. Neurology was consulted and due to findings of distal greater than proximal weakness, a work-up ensued for peripheral neuropathy with possibility of Guillain-Barre syndrome causing the myelopathy. Respiratory therapy noted vital capacity 0.6 to 0.8 although with poor effort being noted and a negative inspiratory force of -30 to -40 with good effort being noted. Lumbar puncture showed normal protein glucose and just one WBC which ruled out acute infectious process, but was considered suggestive of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Despite CSF findings, a five day course of IVIG was initiated on 21 August 2006. After two days of IVIG therapy, improvement was noted with 5/5 strength knee flexion and extension, and 4/5 in plantar flexion; however 2/5 in dorsiflexion bilaterally. Hip flexions were 4+/5 bilaterally. The subject attended physical therapy and was able to sit and stand with minimal assist and was able to ambulate about four feet with a walker with minimal moderate assist. On 23 August 2006, an EMG was performed which showed electrodiagnostic evidence of some segmental demyelination in the motor nerves of both lower extremities; supportive of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility for neurologic rehabilitation therapy after completing day five of IVIG therapy. Discharge medications included LOVENOX 40 mg SC daily for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Upon admission to the skilled nursing facility, neurological examination noted 5/5 bilateral upper extremity strength. Lower extremity: left hip 3/5 muscle strength, and right hip 5/5; 5/5 knee flexion on right and 4/5 knee flexion on the left. Dorsiflexion"

In a foreign   country, the database corresponding to the events temporarily associated with vaccination (ETAV) associated with   H1N1 and seasonal immunization reported between December 2009 and June 2010 was analyzed. Patient's who displayed at least one ETAV after the administration of H1N1 vaccine and/or seasonal influenza vaccine were included. Cases were considered to be probable vaccine-related if they met the temporality criterion, i.e., appearance of the event within the 52 days after vaccination, including immediate hypersensitivity reactions. In terms of association and biological plausibility, a causal ETAV is the one that appears after the administration of the vaccine and requires demonstration through clinical, epidemiological and laboratory findings. It would imply that the vaccine caused the event directly and undoubtedly. When causality cannot be demonstrated, the event is defined as a coincidental ETAV, which refers to medical incidents that would have taken place in the same manner, with or without the application of the vaccine. During the study period, a total of 27,048,330 vaccine doses against H1N1 and 18.442,171 doses against seasonal influenza were applied across the country. A total of 597 ETAV corresponding to the application of the H1N1 and/or anti-seasonal influenza vaccine were reported. A total of 57 events considered serious were reported during the period analyzed. 48 cases could be linked with sanofi pasteur product (manufacturer unknown). All of these cases were linked with the case 2012-01002, considered as case of reference. A 33-year-old male patient, with no medical history nor concomitant therapy reported, had received on an unspecified date his dose of vaccine against seasonal influenza (manufacturer unknown, batch number, number in series, route and site of administration not reported). The vaccine was without adjuvant. On an unspecified date, the patient developed GBS (Guillain Barre syndrome) (reported as initial and final diagnosis). It was not specified if the patient was hospitalized. No corrective treatment was reported. The final outcome was not reported. It was specified that the patient was not died. This interval was reported as ""14"" (no unit reported). According to the author, the event was considered as ""CTAV"" (coincidental temporarily associated with vaccination). According to the author, this case was assessed as serious due to medically important condition. Fourteen confirmed cases of GBS according to Brighton Criteria were reported. All were ruled as unrelated coincidental events, given that vaccination against H1N1 as an antecedent occurred in seven cases (50%); immunization against seasonal influenza occurred in four cases (28.5%), and the joint administration of both vaccines occurred in three cases (21.4%). Documents held by sender: none."
451426-1,"Case received from a consumer on 27-FEB-2012. The reporting consumer was a family member of the patient. Case medically confirmed: hospitalization records provided. A 12-year-old female patient had received the second dose of GARDASIL via an unspecified route on 10-MAY-2010 (dose not reported) (lot number NJ28290, batch number NK30860), and 15 to 20 minutes post-vaccination she experienced headaches. On 12-MAY-2010, since the headaches were persisting, the patient was hospitalized for 5 days. In hospital, the physical examination did not show any abnormality, except for an imbalance to the right revealed by the Romberg's test. Brain and sinuses CT-scan were also performed but showed no changes either. Relevant lab test results as follows: On 13-MAY-2018: - 5000 White Cells with 46.2%N and 34.9%L - Haemoglobin 12.8g/dl - Platelet count at 27100 - Biochemistry: unchanged - PCR: negative - Lumbar puncture: LDH 214 + Glucose 61 + Total Protein 52 + Eritr. 100 + 3 White Cells/mm. On 14-MAY-2010: -MRI with MR angiography: normal. On 17-MAY-2010: - Echocardiogram: normal. On 17-MAY-2010, the patient's examination revealed nystagmus to the right in extreme position. At that time, the neurology department was contacted and advised to maintain vigilance. Tension headaches were first diagnosed. The patient received corrective treatment with paracetamol and ibuprofen. Her condition improved substantially during hospitalization and she was discharged on 17-MAY-2010 and referred to the neurologist. On 01-AUG-2011, the patient was hospitalized again in order to investigate her headaches, as at that time, she presented with strong daily headache episodes at the end of the days, occurring in the frontal region of the both sides of the head and with eye achievement and photophonophobia. She did not experience concomitant nausea or vomiting, and the headaches were slightly improving with ibuprofen. To be noted also that the patient did not wake up with headaches; however, it was hard for her to fall asleep when suffering these episodes. Prior to the headaches onset, she presented with bilateral facial flushing and feeling hot. Then, when the headache started, flushing and feeling hot disappeared. There was no fever and no respiratory symptoms. The patient also complained of widespread pain in legs, with nocturnal predominance: apparently, the pain was located in the muscle mass, not in the articulations. Additional tests were performed during an outer medical visit and showed: - ANA + (1/320 +speckled nucleolar pattern) - Positive anti-thyroid AE. The patient was discharged from hospital on 04-AUG-2011 with the following medication: 40 mg of prednisolone per day, per os during the 5 days, as well as 40 mg of esomeprazole per day. Diagnosis was as follows: headache, suspected autoimmune disease, autoimmune thyroiditis. It is noteworthy that the patient was healthy and had no relevant medical history. She had uneventfully received the first dose of GARDASIL (dose and route not reported) on 15-FEB-2009 (lot number 0773X, batch number NK02490). To be noted that the patient's menarche was in December 2009. Other business partner numbers include E2012-01494. No further information is available."
456438-1,"Initial report received on 18 May 2012 from the Investigator participating in a post-marketing observational surveillance study under the reference number M5A16. A case of pertussis disease in a two-year-old male subject (initials not collected) was identified by the investigator based on review of data from the Electronic Disease Surveillance (EDSS) electronic database. The subject had received 3 doses of PENTACEL; lot number C3436AA received on 05 January 2010, lot number not reported received on 08 March 2010, lot number not reported received on 10 May 2010 and 1 dose of DAPTACEL; lot number C3191AA received on 07 February 2011 (routes and sites of administration not reported). The subject developed cold-like symptoms and cough on 18 April 2012, approximately 14 months after the last dose. On 21 April 2012, the subject developed a paroxysmal cough without a whoop. The subject also experienced sleep disturbance. Laboratory testing included positive PCR on 27 April 2012. Chest x-ray findings were negative for pneumonia. Corrective treatments consisted of azithromycin starting on 27 April 2012 for 5 days. The subject was not hospitalized. At the time of final contact on 02 May 2012, the subject's cough was still persisting. The duration of the cough was reported at that time as 14 days. Investigator causality assessment is not required as per protocol. Company Medical Assessment: No vaccine protects 100% of individuals against infection. Because this case was solicited from an electronic database, medical records are not available so it is unknown if the child had an underlying medical condition or was taking concomitant medications that could have increased vulnerability to infection or inhibited immune response to vaccination. This is one case out of a cumulative total of 67 cases solicited from the EDSS database during the surveillance period from 01 January 2010 to 18 May 2012. These 67 cases represent children who received 3 or more doses of sanofi pasteur vaccine; cases of pertussis disease in children who received DTaP combination vaccines from other manufacturers are not reported as per study protocol. Documents held by sender: None."
485603-1,"This case is linked with the reference case 2013-03135. The following is verbatim from the article abstract: ""BACKGROUND: Because the peak age for incidence of sudden deaths in infancy temporally coincides with the age of infant primary immunization, some have raised the question as to whether immunization is a risk factor for sudden death in infancy. Recent occurrence of two sudden deaths in infants has renewed concerns about the causal association between immunization and sudden deaths in infants. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective review of data. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2011, a total of 45 cases of sudden deaths in the first 2 years of life following immunization were reported. The causes of death were classified as follows: infectious diseases (n = 13); accidental injuries (n =7); congenital abnormalities (n = 2); and malignancy (n = 1). Of 20 sudden deaths in infancy, nine deaths met Brighton Collaboration case definition level I and II, and therefore were classified as possible sudden infant death syndrome cases. Hepatitis B vaccine (n = 13) was the most frequent vaccine with temporal association with sudden deaths in the first 2 years of life. CONCLUSION: Few sudden deaths in the first 2 years of life following immunization have been reported, despite the use of universal immunization. The majority of deaths in infancy did not meet case definition for sudden infant death syndrome. Encouraging investigators to perform thorough investigation, including postmortem autopsy and death scene examination, may promote data comparability and provide guidance on decision-making in the vaccine-safety monitoring and response system. A retrospective review of data from 1994 to 2011 was carried out to describe the epidemiology of sudden death in the first 2 years of life following immunization. For each sudden death case, the demographic information, interval from immunization to presentation, vaccine(s) used, findings from post-mortem examination, and examination of the death scene were reviewed. The present case described an infant patient (age, gender, medical history, risk factors and concomitant therapy not reported), who had received a dose of Haemophilus influenza B vaccine (manufacturer unknown, batch number, route and site of administration not reported) and a dose of Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (other manufacturer, batch number, route and site of administration not reported) on an unspecified date. On an unspecified date after vaccination, the patient experienced sudden unexpected death in the first year of life. This case met the Brighton Collaboration Case Definition (BCCD) level III."
485672-1,"This female subject was enrolled in the post-marketing surveillance study. On 24 July 2012 and 11 September 2012, she received the 1st and 2nd dose of ROTARIX (PO). The subject's past medical history included convulsion. Medical conditions at the time of the event included bronchopneumonia, cytomegalovirus infection and hepatic function abnormal. On 18 August 2012, 25 days after the 1st dose of ROTARIX, this two-month-old subject developed pneumonia and cytomegalovirus infection. On 04 September 2012, she experienced convulsion. The events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention. The subject was treated with and unknown drug. The pneumonia resolved on 25 August 2012. The cytomegalovirus infection resolved on 25 August 2012. The convulsion resolved on 25 September 2012. The investigator considered that there was no reasonable possibility that the pneumonia, cytomegalovirus infection and convulsion many have been caused by ROTARIX. Investigator comments: This case is sent in response to MHRA inspection: Clinical course: 24 July 2012: The subject was vaccinated with the first dose of ROTARIX (oral). Lot number: AROLA428CA. 18 August 2012: The subject experienced pneumonia and Cytomegalovirus infection. 04 September 2012: The subject had a convulsion. 11 September 2012: The subject was vaccinated with the second dose of ROTARIX.

520689-1,"This literature marketed report as received from a physician refers to a 12 years old male patient. Patient's past medical history was remarkable for DiGeorge syndrome, repaired Tetralogy of Fallot and juvenile idiopathic arthritis diagnosed at 15 months of age, which had been controlled for the past 5 years with weekly injections of the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor etanercept. On an unknown date ten days earlier, the patient was inadvertently vaccinated with MMR (Manufacturer unknown) and VARIVAX (Merck) (Manufacturer unknown), during a well-child visit. With the exception of live virus vaccines, he was otherwise up-to-date with his immunizations. On an unknown date, the patient was admitted to hospital with a 2-day history of tactile fevers, sore throat, rash and conjunctivitis. After he developed the tactile fevers his mother held further doses of etanercept, and he was directly admitted to the hospital. On admission, he was afebrile and appeared well. His examination was remarkable for mild conjunctivitis, palatal petechiae with posterior pharyngeal erythema and a blanching morbilliform rash that was present behind the ears, on the face, neck, back, chest and limbs. Mild post auricular cervical lymphadenopathy was present. There were no Koplik spots or vesicular lesions. Due to the possibility of an atypical varicella rash in a patient on a biologic immunomodulatory medication, intravenous acyclovir was initiated. Both urine and skin samples were positive in triplicate for measles virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with 100% matched identity. He had recently undergone immune evaluation with a lymphocyte count of 1100 x 109 cells/L, of which the lymphocyte subsets were normal. The lymphocyte mitogen and antigen studies included low normal responses to Candida and phytohemagglutinin and normal responses to tetanus, concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen. Antibody titers to prior inactivated vaccines were normal. The outcome of tactile fever was unknown. The author stated that although excretion of measles virus in his urine enabled detection and sequencing of the virus as a measles vaccine strain, the diagnosis of vaccine-associated disease was determined from the skin scrapings. Measles virus is present in the skin rash during illness; however, to our knowledge, this is the first reported measles vaccine case in which the vaccine strain was detected and genotyped from the skin rash. Additional information has been requested."
530544-1,"This case was reported by a occupational physician and described the occurrence of severe shaking chills in a 40-year-old male subject who was vaccinated with BOOSTRIX (GlaxoSmithKline). Previous vaccination with (Non-GSK) REVAXIS (Sanofi Pasteur MSD), given about 10 years ago around 2004, has caused similar vaccination complications. On 14 April 2014 the subject received an unspecified booster dose of BOOSTRIX (0.5 ml, unknown). Less than one day post vaccination with BOOSTRIX, on 14 April 2014, the subject experienced severe complications including shaking chills, recurrent high fever of above 40 deg C, heaviness of limbs, joint pain and malaise. The subject has called in sick. At the time of reporting, on 16 April 2014, the outcome of the events was unknown. Follow-up information was received on 05 May 2014 from the reporting occupational physician. The case was upgraded to serious. The subject's medical history included smoking and vaccination complication post vaccination with (non-GSK) REVAXIS (Sanofi Pasteur MSD) about 10 years ago. The subject has no further underlying or concurrent medical conditions or other risk factors. The subject received no concomitant medication. On 14 April 2014 the subject received an unspecified booster dose of BOOSTRIX (0.5 ml, intramuscular, left deltoid). Post vaccination with BOOSTRIX the subject experienced severe complications and was on sick leave for about one week. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK criteria.

The patient's past medical history included tremor limb (Occurred in 5th month of life) and cyst (Fluid cyst in area of neck, occurred in foetal period). On 9th May 2014, the patient received the 3rd dose of ENGERIX B pediatric (intramuscular) .5 ml. On 12th May 2014, 3 days after receiving ENGERIX B pediatric, the patient experienced nystagmus (serious criteria hospitalization) and speech disorder developmental. The patient was treated with VIGANTOL. On an unknown date, the outcome of the nystagmus and speech disorder developmental were recovered/resolved. The reporter considered the nystagmus and speech disorder developmental to be possibly related to ENGERIX B pediatric. Additional details provided as follows: The patient was consulted with neurologist before the vaccination due to occurrence of past tremor of lower limbs and cellular vaccines were recommended. No information about vaccination history and concomitant drugs was provided. The patient received ENGERIX B pediatric in the right thigh. On 12 May 2014, 70 hours after vaccination with ENGERIX B pediatric, the patient experienced nystagmus. The patient experienced nystagmus, which was maintaining for 20 minutes, initially vertical and then horizontal. Nystagmus repeated again after 24 hours. After phone contact the mother took the patient to hospital. Electroencephalogram was performed which showed normal results. At the time of reporting, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of brain was going to be performed. The symptoms did not repeat. The patient also experienced stoppage of speech development. According to the, information from hospital card, after two short episodes of nystagmus during sudden change of body position, the patient was admitted to hospital to do the neurological assessment and give possible treatment. At the admission, in neurological examination no symptoms of focal disorders of peripheral and central nervous system were found. In the electroencephalogram performed no paroxysmal disorders were diagnosed. Due to correct pediatric and neurological condition and correct examination results, no further graphic diagnostic was performed. The patient was discharged to home with recommendations of further consultations in primary care unit and in case of repetition of symptoms, control examinations and performance of magnetic resonance imaging of brain in general anesthetic. The patient was hospitalized from 14 May 2014 to 15 May 2014. The patient was treated with VIGANTOL.

570052-1,"Information has been received from the authors in a literature article as stated above concerning one adult patient older than 50 years old who was vaccinated with herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) and developed significant swelling and tenderness at the injection site. Background/Purpose: Herpes Zoster (HZ) occurs in 1 in 3 people in the USA during their lifetime. The greatest risk factor is age. Immune suppression from illness or medications is also a strong risk factors. RA increases zoster rates 1.5-2 times normal as does > 10mg prednisone per day. Studies are mixed on the role of Mtx and antiTNF's on HZ. herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) has been shown to lower risk and is approved for all patients over 50 by the FDA and recommended for patients over 60 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Guidelines from the ACIP and ACR do not recommend herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) in patients on biologic therapies. However, recent large data-base studies have not found an increase in zoster complications in patients inadvertently given the herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) while on biologics. These data encouraged our group to evaluate the safety of this herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) in current biologic users. Methods: Since July 2012, all 160 patients with RA, PSA and AS receiving IV biologics in our infusion center have been prospectively assessed for Herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) as well as 142 patients on subq biologics for the same indications. RA accounts for 93% of infusion and 66% of subq patients. All biologics were represented. REMICADE was the most common infusion followed by ORENCIA. ENBREL was the most common subq followed by HUMIRA. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for vaccination included: age > 50, no hx anaphylaxis to neomycin or gelatin, no episodes of HZ in last 4 years, pregnancy, patient consent, and disease activity stable- moderate or less on consecutive visits. No patients had an active infection or malignancy. If patient meets criteria, herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) given at next interval scheduled dose of biologic, which is held. Example-hold ENBREL 1 week, HUMIRA 2 weeks, ORENCIA 4 weeks, REMICADE 8 weeks. Mtx was held weeks of vaccine and restarted 1 week post vaccine. Biologic restarted 2 weeks after vaccine. In 17 RITUXAN patients herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) was given 2-4 weeks pre RITUXAN or > than 6 months post RITUXAN. No other vaccines were given the week of the herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown). Results: Of 160 infusion patients 110 (68%) have been vaccinated; over 60% had been on biologic > 5 years, 5% < 1 year. No patient developed disseminated HZ. One patient had significant swelling and tenderness at the injection site. Most common reasons not to vaccinate: 11 with recent HZ, 14 <age 50, and 17 with disease activity issues. Of 142 subq patients, 42 (32%) have been vaccinated; over 50% had been on biologic> 5 eyars, 10% < 1 year. No patients developed disseminated HZ or had a significant local reaction. Most common reasons not to vaccinate: 74 patients <50, 12 with disease activity issues, 5 with herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) concerns and 5 with recent HZ. No patients in either group developed HZ within the six weeks post vaccination. Two patients vaccinated since 2012 in our infusion cohort have developed HZ at 16 and 20 months and none in the subq patients. Prior to 2012, only 7 and 8% of the cohorts had received herpes zoster vaccine (manufactuer unknown). Conclusion: herpes zoster vaccine (manufacturer unknown) vaccination in chronic RA, PSA or AS patients on current IV or subq biologic therapies appears safe using this protocol. No occurrence of disseminated HZ occurred. There was no increased incidence of HZ in the early post vaccination period.

601662-1,"Initial unsolicited report received from the literature on 02 October 2015. The following is verbatim from the article: We describe a case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) occurring 15 days after the first dose of a 4-dose rabies vaccination series. ITP is thought to be an immune-mediated process triggered by an infection or toxin. There is little evidence in the literature beyond case reports of an association of ITP with vaccines other than with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. This is the third reported case of ITP associated with rabies vaccination. Because of the rare occurrence of this adverse event relative to the severity of rabies infection, the benefits of rabies vaccination, when indicated, outweigh the low and possible risk of ITP. This case involves a patient (age and gender not reported) who was vaccinated with four-dose series of Rabies vaccine (batch number, expiration date, dose, route and site of administration were not reported) on an unspecified date. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. On an unspecified date, 15 days after the first dose of vaccination, the patient experienced immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

636387-1,"Initial and follow up information has been received from a physician on 07-APR-2016 and 16-MAY-2016 respectively, concerning a 65 year old female patient with rheumatoid arthritis and hypothyroidism who on 29-MAR-2016 was vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX NP injection subcutaneously 0.5 ml once a day (lot number not reported). She had no allergy. Information on her medical history was not obtained. Concomitant therapies included MOBIC, THYRADIN-S, prednisolone (manufacturer unknown), RIMATIL, RHEUMATREX, FOLIAMIN, ACTONEL, EDIROL and famotidine (manufacturer unknown). On 29-MAR-2016, the patient received PNEUMOVAX NP at another hospital. On 30-MAR-2016, swelling and redness developed at the injection site of PNEUMOVAX NP on the left upper arm. The patient developed pyrexia (39.6 degrees C) and pain, while at the same time, C-reactive protein (CRP) increased to 1.17 mg/dL and white blood cells (WBC) at 12480/micro-l, showing worsening infection. She had disturbed consciousness. Upon presentation to the reporter's hospital, she was admitted for the purposes of careful examination and treatment, and diagnosed with cellulitis (Onset of cellulitis and adrenal insufficiency). On 31-MAR-2016, a cause of disturbed consciousness was diagnosed as adrenal insufficiency secondary to cellulitis. Cortisol was micro-g/dl, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 838.7pg/ml. For the treatment of disturbed consciousness, SOLU-CORTEF was administered 100 mg per day until 01-APR-2016. As for antibiotics, piperacillin sodium (+) tazobactam sodium 4.5 g, 3 times a day was administered until 04-APR-2016. On 01-APR-2016, WBC was 19530/micro-l and CRP was 15.59 mg/dL, showing peak inflammatory reactions. On 02-APR-2016, for the treatment of disturbed consciousness, CORTRIL 50 mg per day was administered until 03-APR-2016. From 04-APR-2016 on, hydrocortisone 30 mg per day was administered until 05-APR-2016 (but from 06-APR-2016 it was discontinued). WBC was 4870/micro-l, CRP 2.04 mg/dL. On 05-APR-2016 antibiotics AUGMENTIN combination tablet 250 mg, 3 times a day were administered until 07-APR-2016. On an unspecified date, disturbed consciousness improved as a result of treatment with hydrocortisone sodium succinate and hydrocortisone. Inflammatory reaction and cellulitis also gradually improved. On 07-APR-2016, WBC was 5860/micro-l, and CRP was 0.6 mg/dL. On 08-APR-2016, she was discharged home with good general condition. At the time of her discharge, only remaining symptoms were mild redness and swelling (Cellulitis resolved). At the time of this report, the outcome of adrenal insufficiency was unknown. The reporter's comment: Since the patient had been under a long term oral medication of steroids for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, her adrenal function was declining. Cellulitis caused by PNEUMOVAX NP resulted in relative adrenal insufficiency, leading to disturbed consciousness. The reporting physician considered that the cellulitis was serious due to hospitalization and other important medical event, and that adrenal insufficiency was serious due to hospitalization. The reporting physician considered that the cellulitis was related to PNEUMOVAX NP with no causative factors other than the drug, and did not assess causal relationship between adrenal insufficiency and PNEUMOVAX NP. Upon internal review, adrenal insufficiency was determined to be medically significant. No further information is available. Patient details, relevant history, product, lab data, event details and narrative were updated."

(Same literature). The following is verbatim from the article: Background: Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The risk of anaphylaxis after vaccination has not been well described in adults or with newer vaccines in children. Objective: We sought to estimate the incidence of anaphylaxis after vaccines and describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed cases of anaphylaxis. Methods: Using health care data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink, we determined rates of anaphylaxis after vaccination in children and adults. We first identified all patients with a vaccination record from January 2009 through December 2011 and used diagnostic and procedure codes to identify potential anaphylaxis cases. Medical records of potential cases were reviewed. Confirmed cases met the Brighton Collaboration definition for anaphylaxis and had to be determined to be vaccine triggered. We calculated the incidence of anaphylaxis after all vaccines combined and for selected individual vaccines. Results: We identified 33 confirmed vaccine-triggered anaphylaxis cases that occurred after 25,173,965 vaccine doses. The rate of anaphylaxis was 1.31 (95 percent CI, 0.90-1.84) per million vaccine doses. The incidence did not vary significantly by age, and there was a non-significant female predominance. Vaccine-specific rates included 1.35 (95 percent CI, 0.65-2.47) per million doses for inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (10 cases, 7,434,628 doses given alone) and 1.83 (95 percent CI, 0.22-6.63) per million doses for inactivated monovalent influenza vaccine (2 cases, 1,090,279 doses given alone). The onset of symptoms among cases was within 30 minutes (8 cases), 30 to less than 120 minutes (8 cases), 2 to less than 4 hours (10 cases), 4 to 8 hours (2 cases), the next day (1 case), and not documented (4 cases). Conclusion: Anaphylaxis after vaccination is rare in all age groups. Despite its rarity, anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening medical emergency that vaccine providers need to be prepared to treat. This case involves a 04-year-old male patient who was vaccinated with a dose of TDAP; with a dose of IPV; with a dose of MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA VACCINE; with a dose of VARICELLA (batch number, dose, route and site of administration was not reported) on an unspecified date. Medical history reported as Asthma, allergic conjunctivitis and rhinitis and concomitant medications were not reported. On unspecified date, less than 30 minutes following the vaccination, the patient had experienced Angioedema (eyelids, lips), generalized rash, facial erythema and urticaria, wheeze, swelling (lips, throat) and anaphylaxis. On an unknown date, the patient was referred to pediatrician. On an unknown date, the patient evaluated by allergist in clinic. Laboratory data were not reported. The patient received corrective treatment with Epinephrine, parenteral antihistamine, parenteral H2-blocker, parenteral steroid, Oxygen (O2), other (continued antibiotic). On an unspecified date, patient was recovered from all the events. Upon internal review the case was considered as serious because of important medical event: Anaphylaxis. List of documents held by sender: none. Sender's Comments: The reported symptoms and time to onset are consistent with the diagnosis of anaphylactic reaction.

Administration of company suspect drug(s): On an unknown date, the patient received Influenza Virus Vaccine (INN) for indication not reported. Dose regimen: Not reported, Route of administration: Not Reported. Batch number: Not reported. No additional suspect drugs. Adverse reactions/events and outcomes: On an unknown date two weeks following influenza vaccination, the patient experienced stiff person syndrome (SPS) (medically significant, outcome: not recovered / not resolved). Associated symptoms included: abnormal relaxation of the lower and upper esophageal sphincters, antibodies to pancreatic islet cells were found to be elevated, diplopia, fourth [and sixth] nerve palsies, hyperreflexia in the lower extremities, increased tone in the lower extremities, intermittent urinary retention, outlet obstruction (anorectal), progressive cramping and spasms in the lower extremities, sensation of the urge to defecate was felt at lower volumes (100 ml) than normal (120 ml), serum anti-GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibody titer was highly elevated at 250 units/ml, severe constipation, sixth nerve palsies, spastic gait, toe walking, wheelchair-bound state. The patient presented with intermittent urinary retention and constipation for approximately 2 months, followed by progressive cramping and spasms in the lower extremities that were triggered by startle, stress, loud noises, and tactile stimulation. Initial symptoms started 2 weeks after influenza vaccination. On examination, increased tone and hyperreflexia in the lower extremities were accompanied by spastic gait and toe walking. Symptoms progressed to a wheelchair-bound state, complicated by severe constipation. The urologist determined the need for suprapubic bladder catheterization for urinary retention management. The patient experienced 2 self-limiting episodes of diplopia and was diagnosed with fourth and, respectively, sixth nerves palsies. Urinary retention and constipation resolved after 2 months of IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) therapy. Lower extremity spasms and gait impairment improved with IVIG, baclofen and diazepam; maintenance therapy was required to assure fully ambulatory state, return to full-time job and cardio exercises. Urodynamic studies were not performed in the patient despite obtaining urological consultations. The urologists felt confident that the tightness of the urethral sphincter caused urinary retention based on extremely difficult catheterization and therefore advanced catheterization techniques were applied. Manometry studies were not repeated after immunomodulation therapies, given symptoms resolved completely. Persistent elevation of anti-GAD65 antibodies despite successful immunotherapy was seen in the patient. Serologic monitoring is not recommended and the optimal therapy duration is unclear. The patient had recurrence of symptoms with discontinuing IVIG and has remained on it. Relevant tests: Serum anti-GAD65 antibody titer was highly elevated at 250 units/mL and antibodies to pancreatic islet cells were found elevated as well. Serologic workup for infections, autoimmune and paraneoplastic conditions, brain and spine MR (magnetic resonance) imaging, CT (computed tomography) chest, abdomen, and pelvis was unrevealing. Esophageal manometry revealed a prolonged refractory phase of esophageal peristalsis and abnormal relaxation of the lower and upper esophageal sphincters. The high-resolution anorectal manometry interpretation was consistent with outlet obstruction because internal anal sphincter did not relax with balloon distension during normal values and sensation of the urge to defecate was felt at lower volumes (100 mL) than normal (120 mL).

A 35 years old female patient received on 13-DEC-1978 a dose of MM-VAX (lot # 621191/1549D, batch # 1549D is a valid # for varicella virus vaccine). Site of administration not reported. According to information given by her mother the patient showed mild signs of infection. Naturally, after more than 30 years, the person reporting could no longer remember the vaccination, and the medical records were destroyed ten years after the family moved away. The patient had mumps shortly after the vaccination. Since the beginning of 1989, that was to say, more than 10 years after the vaccination, she had increasing problems with walking. In June 1991, the previously mentioned diagnosis (focal spinal muscular atrophy of the peroneal type) was finally made in the Department of Neurology at the hospital. Genetic testing at that time showed no familial origin. The patient today was still considerably disabled. The person reporting had not, however, seen her for the past 30 years. Now her parents told that the patient's condition could be attributed to this vaccination 32 years ago, and the mother asked him to report the case. A mumps-measles vaccine had marketing authorization under the measles virus vaccine live mumps virus vaccine live dry substance with solvent s.c. (the agency: 00408) but it was no longer on the market. Today such vaccines were usually triple combinations with rubella. Rare chronic myalgias were listed as known ADRs in the information for Healthcare Professionals of triple vaccines, although none of them mentioned dystrophy associated with paralysis. In the literature, there was a case report of a 16-month-old girl who developed transient hemiparesis which recovered completely. The information system gave various neurological complications in temporal relationship to MMR vaccinations, but there was no mention of spinal muscular atrophy or other forms of anterior horn disease. According to the WHO ADR database, 10912 cases in which MMR vaccinations were associated with all possible forms of paralysis have been reported since 1975. However, in all the databases we could access, spinal muscular atrophy was not mentioned in associated with a mumps-measles-rubella vaccine or with mumps. The sporadic cases were explained by the new mutations. We had no information about genetic testing of the family. Because of the long interval of more than 10 years between the vaccination and the onset of symptoms, the lack of any evidence in the literature, the genetic testing from 1991 which could not have been carried out as completely as it would be with today's knowledge and diagnostic possibilities, and the existence of alternative explanations (spontaneous mutation), we considered a causal relationship between the vaccine and spinal muscular atrophy to be unlikely. The final course was not reported. The agency was not the agency at the time of vaccination . No further information was available. Other business partner numbers include E2010-04237. This case involves M-M-VAX, which contains two of the active moieties of MMR II. Therefore, this case is being submitted to the agency for MMR II"

420522-1,"Information has been received from a consumer concerning his approximately 4 year old female daughter who on 28-MAR-1994 was vaccinated with her first dose of MMR II (Lot number 618168/0885D). On 21-Jul-1997, the patient was vaccinated in her right arm with her second dose of MMR II (Lot number 618168/0885D). It was reported that following the second dose the patient nearly died and experienced several adverse effects. In 1997, the patient developed mood, memory, and intellectual changes. She exhibited autistic symptoms and became ""zombie-like."" She experienced dehydration, would stop eating and sleeping, and had fecal impaction on different occasions over the last few years. In 1998, the patient nearly died because she was extremely dehydrated with acidosis. She has been treated with mental health medications but her symptoms worsened and therefore her medications were discontinued. The reporter stated he has sought medical attention for his daughter and that she had been in the hospital on four separate occasions for a total of three months in the past few years and had six emergency room visits. The consumer reported his daughter's symptoms have worsened during puberty. She currently had cerebral edema. The consumer believed many of his daughter's symptoms were caused by a reaction to sorbitol. The consumer reported that on 23-OCT-1993, his daughter was also vaccinated with DTAP and this vaccine may have contributed to her symptoms. The patient's outcome has not recovered. Upon internal review, autistic symptoms was determined to be an other important medical event. Additional information has been requested."
430364-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of status epilepticus in a 10-month-old female subject who was vaccinated with HEPATITIS B (manufacturer unspecified), DTAP, pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (non-gsk) and IPV (non-gsk). The subject's medical history included cough and rhinorrhea during one week prior to vaccination otherwise, she was healthy. Her father had childhood febrile seizures. On an unspecified date, the subject received 3rd dose of HEPATITIS B vaccine (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided), 3rd dose of DTAP (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided), an unspecified dose of pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (NON-GSK) (unknown) and 3rd dose of IPV (NON-GSK) (unknown). 18 hours after vaccination with DTAP, HEPATITIS B vaccine, pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (NON-GSK) and IPV (Non-GSK), the subject experienced status epilepticus, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hypertonia nos, hyper reflexia and fever (101.3 F). Otherwise, the physical exam was normal. The subject was hospitalised. Laboratory evaluation included a normal complete blood count, metabolic panel, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Blood, urine and CSF bacterial cultures were negative. She had a normal head MRI and CT scan, negative pertussis direct fluorescent antibody and culture, and negative fluorescent antibody test for adenovirus, RSV, and influenza. Serology was negative for arboviruses, EBV, and mycoplasma. CSF was negative for HSV and enterovirus by polymerase chain reaction. The subject was treated with anticonvulsant, acyclovir, ceftriaxone and intubation. At the time of reporting, the events were resolved. The author considered the events were probably related to vaccination with HEPATITIS B vaccine, DTAP, pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (NON-GSK) and IPV (Non-GSK). Summary of the literature article: In 2004 the Clinical Consult Case Review (CCCR) working group was formed within the CDC-funded Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network to review individual cases of adverse events following immunizations (AEFI). Cases were referred by practitioners, health departments, or CDC employees. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) searches and literature reviews for similar cases were performed prior to review. After CCCR discussion, AEFI were assessed for a causal relationship with vaccination and recommendations regarding future immunizations were relayed back to the referring physicians. In 2010, surveys were sent to referring physicians to determine the utility and effectiveness of the CCCR service. CISA investigators reviewed 76 cases during 68 conference calls between April 2004 and December 2009. Almost half of the cases (35/76) were neurological in nature. Similar AEFI for the specific vaccines received were discovered for 63 cases through VAERS searches and for 38 cases through PubMed searches. Causality assessment using the probably related, 16 as possibly related, 18 as unlikely related, 10 as unrelated, and 17 had insufficient information to assign causality. The physician satisfaction survey was returned by 30 (57.7%) of those surveyed and a majority of respondents (93.3%) felt that the CCCR service was useful. The author's conclusion stated that the CCCR provides advice about AEFI to practitioners, assigns potential causality, and contributes to an improved understanding of adverse health events following immunizations."

This healthcare professional reported similar events for the same patient. This is one of two reports. A 6-month-old male patient received the second dose of PREVENAR 13 along with the second dose of INFANRIX-POLIO+HIB on 18May2011. Relevant history included laryngomalacia, reflux, convulsion-like attacks from the age of two months and Epileptiform attacks NOS. The patient was medicated for a period when epilepsy was thought to be a cause of the convulsion-like attacks. Past product history included convulsion with no fever after the first dose of PREVENAR 13 and INFANRIX-POLIO+HIB on 17Mar2011, resulting in hospitalization and EEG. At that time, the medications for epilepsy were discontinued. On 19May2011, the patient experienced two convulsion-like attacks with no fever. Two days later, the patient developed a fever of 39.5 degrees Celsius, together with vomiting and three convulsion-like attacks. Two of the attacks lasted for two minutes and the third lasted for five minutes. Therapeutic measures taken as a result of the events included treatment with STESOLID (rectal). The child was hospitalized. Two more attacks occurred on the same day, and three attacks occurred on the following day. Since then, the patient experienced no more attacks. At the time, medications for epilepsy were not recommended. It was reported that the physicians in the hospital thought the attacks were fever convulsions. The foreign Medicines Agency assessed this case as serious with the seriousness criteria of hospitalization and medically important condition and the causality as possible. On follow-up, the foreign Medicines Agency provided information from the discharge summary from the hospital as follows: Discharge diagnoses included unspecified epilepsy, unspecified fever, unspecified gastroesophageal reflux without esophagitis and the convulsion attacks described by reporter are verified. Due to high fever there was carried out bacterial growth of blood and CSF, and treatment with ampicillin and gentamycin. Negative findings of bacterial growth were reported and cessation of antibiotic treatment occurred. C-reactive protein results: 9, 12 and 8 by three occasions. EEG results: Interictal epileptic activity in left hemisphere. The EEG will be repeated. A pediatric neurologist thought treatment with TEGRETOL was indicated. The mother wants to wait, but realize that it may be necessary. Further follow-up is planned. The mother also was advised as to the gastroesophageal reflux. The outcome for epilepsy was unknown and the outcome for the events of febrile convulsion, vomiting, pyrexia and convulsions was recovered. No follow-up attempts possible.

555236-1,"On June 17th 2013 I was sent to facility to have a routine TB test before I could begin my work as a volunteer.   I met with a P.A. who gave me a brief medical exam and then a Medical Assistant who said she would administer my vaccine.  Shortly after I was given a vaccination in the right forearm and told to come back for a follow up reading for my TB test.   About an hour after I had left I received a call.  I was told that the vaccination I was given was incorrect. She stated that in error I was given the Tdap vaccine instead of a TB test.  I was told that I would be fine but to come back tomorrow for the proper vaccine.  I immediately called facility and spoke with volunteer coordinator to inform him of the error.  He stated that he was unaware of the incident and that  nothing like this had ever happened before  and agreed to meet me at the clinic for my follow up the next day.   The next day June 18th 2013 I awoke with my right arm swollen and red around the injection area which was forming a small, hot, hard  lump. I called facility and spoke with volunteer coordinator to inform him of the swelling and pain in my right arm he suggested that I come in as soon as possible that day instead of the late afternoon scheduled time.   On June 18th 2013 I went back to facility and asked for volunteer coordinator and he was not available.  I began working the medical assistant that gave me the wrong vaccine and Physician Assistant.  Medical assistant stated  that she had given me the Tdap because she thought the T in Tdap was for TB.   I was told by the P.A. that the injection for Tdap should not have been applied in my  forearm at all and that it was also applied incorrectly under the skin in the manner of a TB  that should have been given. The P.A.  examined my arm in the Lobby and stated that  the hard lump may need to be cut out if it continued to spread around my forearm.    I was not comfortable with the information I was given and asked to speak with a supervisor and waited in the Lobby for 30 minutes. I met with Dr. who took me into a patient room and examined my arm.  I was told to put ice to reduce swelling and given Tylenol and Aleve and told to come back the next day for a follow up. The following day I awoke with extreme pain and my arm even more swollen.  The area of injection was hot and painful and had become even more of a solid mass.  I returned to facility on June 19th 2013 my arm was examined by the P.A. and Dr. I informed them of the increasing pain from my entire hand up to neck on the right side, numbness and lack of function/movement.  My entire right limb was red, swollen and hot.  I waited in the exam room for nearly an hour and was given a bottle of prescribed antibiotics and more Tylenol by Dr. He said that I should take the prescription he had filled for me along with the Tylenol and I would be fine by weeks end.  Later that same day June 19th I returned to facility to speak with Dr. again about the pain in my neck and arm.  I asked for blood work and an ultrasound/ X-ray to be given but Dr. only tried to assure me the pain would be relieved with the antibiotics and Tylenol he had given me.  He stated  he had more than 20 years  experience and that by weeks end I would be fine.   He asked me to trust him and I was then sent to be attended to by a nurse whom I had not worked with.  She applied a topical ointment to my arm because the injection area was increasingly swollen and red/purple.  The area of injection was covered it with a bandage and I was told to come back with any further issues or concerns. On June 20th 2013 I returned to facility.

564721-1,"Information has been received from the authors in a published article. Background and objectives: All measles-containing vaccines are associated with several types of adverse events, including seizure, fever, and immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). Because the MMRV vaccine compared with the separate MMR and MMR + V vaccine increases a toddler's risk for febrile seizures, we investigated whether MMRV is riskier than MMR + V and whether either vaccine elevates the risk for additional safety outcomes. Methods: This was a cohort study that included children aged 12 to 23 months who were members of 8 Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) sites from January 2000 through June 2012 and who received PROQUAD (Merck) or separately administered, same-day M-M-R II + VARIVAX (Merck) vaccines. Nine study outcomes were investigated: 7 main outcomes (anaphylaxis, ITP, ataxia, arthritis, meningitis encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Kawasaki disease), seizure, and fever. Comparing MMRV with MMR + V, relative risk was estimated by using stratified exact binomial tests. Secondary analyses examined post-MMRV or MMR + V risk versus comparison intervals; risk and comparison intervals were then contrasted for MMRV versus MMR+V. Results: A total of 123 200 MMRV doses and 584 987 MMR + V doses administered to children 12 to 23 months old from 2000 to 2012 were evaluated. Overall, rates for the 7 main outcomes during postvaccination risk intervals were low, with several outcomes having few or zero events in the risk interval after either vaccine. Estimated risk differences between MMRV and MMR + V were not statistically significant for any of the 7 main outcomes, although it was for seizure, comparing MMRV with MMR + V, the risk difference that can be ruled out with 95% confidence ranged from 0.5 case (Kawasaki disease, days 1-28) to 35 cases (ataxia, days 1-42) per 100 000 MMRV doses. In the primary analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in risk between MMRV and MMR + V during either the focal or broad risk interval for the 7 main outcomes. Analyses of seizures after October 2008 confirmed that MMRV, compared with MMR + V, was associated with a twofold increased risk 7 to 10 days after vaccination. Secondary analyses comparing risk versus comparison intervals after MMRV or MMR + V revealed an increased risk of ITP and a decreased risk of ataxia after both vaccines. Analyses also detected an increased risk for anaphylaxis after MMRV. This result was based on only 2 cases, neither of which was confirmed as acute anaphylaxis after chart review; both diagnoses were related to a history of allergic reactions. Similar to the primary analysis, there were no significant differences in risk for the 7 main outcomes during any risk interval comparing MMRV with MMR + V. After MMR + V, the risk of ataxia was significantly lower during the risk interval. For the remaining outcomes, risk differences that can be ruled out with 95% confidence ranged from 0.08 case (arthritis) to 11 cases (ITP II, days 1-42) per 100 000 MMR + V doses. Similarly, ataxia risk was significantly lower after MMRV. For the remaining outcomes, we could rule out risk differences that ranged from 0.5 case (Kawasaki disease, days 1-28) to 10 cases (ITP I, days 1-42) per 100 000 MMRV doses. Case-centered analyses demonstrated a significantly increased risk of seizure and fever 7 to 10 days after both MMRV and MMR + V and confirmed that MMRV, compared with MMR + V, was associated with a significantly higher risk for seizure and fever 7 to 10 days after vaccination. Conclusions: This study did not identify any new safety concerns comparing MMRV with MMR + V or after either the MMRV or the MMR + V vaccine. This study provides reassurance that these outcomes are unlikely after either vaccine. This report refers to 6 patients aged 12 to 23 months of unknown gender who enrolled in this study.

On 22nd July 2016, the patient started MALARONE at an unknown dose and frequency. In July 2016, 3 days after receiving TWINRIX adult and MALARONE, the patient experienced joint pain and fever. On an unknown date, the patient experienced enlargement of lymph nodes and headache. On an unknown date, the outcome of the joint pain, fever, enlargement of lymph nodes and headache were not recovered/not resolved. The reporter considered the joint pain, fever, enlargement of lymph nodes and headache to be related to TWINRIX adult and MALARONE. Additional details were provided as follows: On 16th June 2016, the patient received the 1st dose of TWINRIX adult. In July 2016, 3 to 4 days after receiving TWINRIX adult 2nd dose and MALARONE, patient began to experience pain in the joints and fever. In 2016, less than a month after receiving TWINRIX adult and MALARONE, the patient experienced enlargement of lymph nodes and headache. All the symptoms were still present. On 4th August 2016, patient went to the emergency room, where she was examined but nothing was found that could explain her symptoms. Follow up information was received on 8th September 2016 from consumer: The case was upgraded to serious. The patient's demographic details were updated. After 3 to 4 days of vaccination with TWINRIX adult and MALARONE, the patient experienced Rickettsia tick borne disease (GSK medically significant). The patient had visited the emergency room where they thought she possibly suffered a 24-hour virus. On holiday, she became worse and went to another hospital, which found that she suffered from Rickettsia tick-borne disease. The patient received treatment with DOXYFERM in two rounds. The patient was now well and had only a few remaining rashes. The reporter considered all events to be unrelated to TWINRIX adult and MALARONE.

The outcome(s) of the additional event(s) included cough (unknown), pruritus (unknown), headache (unknown), hypertension (unknown), tachycardia (unknown) and interchange of vaccine products (unknown). The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the anaphylaxis, cough, pruritus, headache, hypertension and tachycardia may have been caused by Human papilloma type 16 + 18 vaccine + AS04D. Additional information was provided. This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of anaphylaxis in a patient aged between 12 and 16-year of unspecified gender who was vaccinated with CERVARIX (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient was a part of the study that aimed to formalise a collaborative adverse events following immunisation clinical assessment network (AEFI-CAN) following the expansion of the HPV immunisation program for boys in 2013. In this study data was collected retrospectively (1st January-1st August 2013) and prospectively (2nd August 2013-30th October 2014). Quarterly reports were provided to the Department of health. On an inspected date, the patient received 1st dose of GARDASIL. No information on patient's medical history, family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On unspecified dates between 1 January 2013 and 30 June 2014, the patient received 2 doses of CERVARIX (administration route and site unspecified; batch number not provided). On an unspecified date between 1 January 2013 and 30 June 2014, 8 min after the 2nd dose of CERVARIX, the patient developed anaphylaxis-pruritus of left shoulder and headache, hypertension, tachycardia and cough. The patient was treated with adrenaline and antihistamine. The outcome of the event was not reported. The authors did not comment on the relationship between anaphylaxis-pruritus left shoulder and headache, hypertension, tachycardia and cough and CERVARIX. The authors concluded that ""A comprehensive system for detecting adverse events is important for the safe and efficacious implementation of a immunisation program. AEFI demonstrated the advantages of a clinical assessment network to provide a collaborative approach to AEFI detection and management. It provided a regular forum for clinical discussion and planning for individual patients following serious or unexpected adverse events following immunisation. The AEFI network had been utilised for the HPV vaccine program but had potential broader application to all vaccines on the Immunization program"". This is 1 of the 5 valid cases reported in the same literature article."

179137-1,"It was reported in a published article that a 54 year old female with inclusion body myositis was vaccinated in 10/96 with a 3rd dose of Hep-B vaccine recombinant (yeast); 1st in 3/96 and 2nd in 4/96. In 1997, the pt presented with a 6 year history of progressive lower limb weakness and falls. An exam revealed mild dysphagia, upper and lower limb proximal muscle weakness and lower limb distal muscle wasting and weakness, especially of foot extensors. Investigations show elevated muscle enzymes (CK 6 X nml), and myopathic and neuropathic changes on EMG. The pt was treated with prednisone 1mg/kg daily for 6 months without clinical improvement except for the disappearance of dysphagia. It was noted that her muscle enzymes dropped to normal values. The prednisone dose was gradually reduced and then stopped. In 10/98, the pt developed a gradual deterioration in her muscle strength, the appearance of disabling myalgia and the elevation of CK levels, which led to justification of a new muscle exam. A deltoid biopsy showed IBM associated with specific changes of macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF). However, re-exam of the 1st muscle biopsy, performed in 1997, confirmed the initial presence of IBM, without MMR. IV gamma globulin and a resistance training program were started with the disappearance of myalgia, stabilization of muscle weakness and reduction of CK levels. It was noted that the unexpected appearance of myalgia during the course of painless inclusion body myositis must arouse the suspicion of an association of another inflammatory muscle disease, macrophagic myofasciitis. It was noted that 1 interpretation of the occurence of both MMF and sporadic IBM suggests a genetic susceptibility to dysimmune muscle disease, perhaps due to defects of presenting cell aluminic vaccination with Hep-B recombinant (yeast) before the appearance of myalgia. It was not reported if the pt fully recovered from the IBM or the MMF. Macrophagic myofasciitis was considered to be disabling. Upon internal review, inclusion body myositis was determined to be an ""Other Important Medical Event"". No further information is available. The reaction onset date has been changed from 1991 to 1997."

I have attempted to obtain the exact date of inoculation through my employer. However, the employee health and medical records staff are unable to provide me with documentation re:date of my flu shot. I have seen many physicians/specialists and have undergone many diagnostic tests in the past 2 years. Many diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, several types of neuropathies, Lyme diseases, autoimmune diseases, etc.., have been ruled out through diagnostic tests, including foot/ankle/brain/spine MRIs, x-rays, and blood tests. I still do not have a clear diagnosis. Many physicians have suggested that my symptoms and subsequent physical limitations may be related to a virus, but it is only in the recent month that a ""new"" neurologist has recommended that I formally file a VAERS form. My symptoms are localized to the bottoms of both of my feet. Prior to pain management with medication, I experienced extremely severe hot knife-stabbing pain, which restricted my ability to tolerate standing (even for 5 mins) or walking. I also experienced paresthesias/numbness even when I was not weighbearing. I also lost motor function of 2 of my toes and developed ankle weakness. I have been severely limited in function since onset of these symptoms. I was essentially housebond the first 3 months of these symptoms. I was gradually able to tolerate more walking once I started taking neurontin and with the use of crutches (which allowed me to walk maybe 200 ft before my symptoms would increase).

223895-1,"Our son is a 14 month old male with hydrocephalus. He has a VP shunt that was placed 4 days after birth of 5/20/03. His medical history included a shunt revision on 7/3/03 as well as a series of hospitalizations for either possible shunt issues or seizures. Three of his seizures and hospitalizations occurred the day of, or the day after receiving immunizations. The following is an account of his most recent seizure which occurred the same day he received his most recent immunizations. He was given two injections on 6/30/04 at approximately 11:30 AM for childhood immunizations, Varicella vaccine and ComVax for MMR. The vaccines were administered under the direction of a doctor at the clinic. We provided medical records from his previous physician regarding the 2 other incidents of seizure following his immunizations in September and November of last year. After a discussion with the doctor, and prior consultation with a neurologist, the doctor recommended that he receive only 2 of his 3 scheduled shots, the decision was made to suspend the vaccine for DTP for at least 6 weeks. The doctor's office consulted with another doctor about controlling the fever associated with giving immunizations, as this was the suspected cause of the seizures. The doctor recommended Tylenol be given every four hours around the clock in order to control the fever and prevent a seizure. At approximately 10:30 PM on the same night, 6/30/04, he began seizing in bed at approximately 10:30 PM. His left arm and left leg were uncontrollably moving up and down. At 10:35 PM, we administered his prescription medication, Diastat, which is suppose to stop the seizures. At approximately 11:00 PM, the seizure was still occurring, although less severe. We called 911 and he was taken to the hospital at approximately 11:30 PM. The seizure stopped by the time he arrived at the hospital around midnight. This initial seizure lasted more than one hour. He was initially seen by the emergency room physician, blood was drawn, and an IV started. He had a CT Scan and x-ray's of his shunt to check for potential blockage. I believe this was in response to my comment to the emergency room physician that he had a shunt revision in July 2003, when the shunt was blocked with protein according to his neurosurgeon. The results of his CT scan was negative and shunt issues were ruled out. He had a second seizure about 2:15 AM that lasted approximately 70 minutes. This time the seizure was on the right side of his body, and was violent in nature. The emergency physician gave him a series of injections that included Adavan and Phenobarbital, to stabilize him. These injections brought about little response and the seizure continued. A respiratory therapist administered oxygen to him until he was transferred to the triage room after about 50 minutes of non-stop seizing. The emergency physician gave him more Ativan, and was preparing to give him a drug to lose consciousness when the seizure stopped. At approximately 4:00 AM, his seizure stopped and at approximately 4:20 AM a decision by the emergency physician to complete a spinal tap before transferring him to ICU approximately at 5:00 AM. He was seen by the ICU staff physician upon entering ICU. A neurologist was assigned to him along with a member of the hospital's pediatric group. His phenobarbital dose was raised from 6ml twice daily to 8ml twice daily. On 7/1/04, he was transferred out of ICU to a regular hospital room.

On 03Nov04, 06Dec04 and 21Apr05, the subject received the 1st, 2nd and 3rd IM injection of blinded study vaccine in the left deltoid. The subject had been randomized to receive the active control in this trial, an investigational formulation of Havrix vaccine containing 720 ELISA units of hep A antigen and 500 ug Al (OH)3. Lot number was not provided. The subject's past medical history included 2 pregnancies, one parity and no abortion. Personal and family medical history were negative. The subject had regular menstrual cycles of 30*3days and she used intrauterine device for birth control. On 04Nov05, 6 months after the 3rd dose of blinded vaccine, this 25 yr old subject was reported (by a relative) to be pregnant. Her last menstrual period was unk. The estimated delivery date was 22Feb06. A subject's relative reported that on 02Nov05, seven months after the 3rd dose of blinded vaccine, this 25 yr old subject experienced vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. On the same day she went to the local clinic and was transferred to the local hospital where she was admitted. The subject was diagnosed as having false preterm labor because she presented 3cm dilatation. On 15Nov05, a subject's relative reported that on 08Nov05, this subject gave birth, apparently without complications, to a female infant reported as abnormal because her weight was only 1kg with an apgar score unk, by normal vaginal delivery. Based on this information, the investigator changed the diagnosis into preterm delivery. The subject was discharged on 10Nov05. Her baby was in the hospital to gain more weight (see case B0399571B). The preterm delivery was considered as clinically significant. The investigator considered that there was no reasonable possibility that the preterm delivery may have been caused by investigational product. Follow up received on 17Nov05: Last menstrual period occurred on 17May05. The subject was therefore exposed to the vaccine before conception. Follow up received on 01Jun06: The subject attended her twelve month visit on 01Jun06 and reported that she was discharged on 11Nov05. She did not have any complications during or after the delivery and was considered recovered on the day of discharge. Follow up received on 06Jun06: The subject delivered on 09Nov05 after 38 wks of pregnancy. The neonate had an Apgar score of 9. Follow up received on 22Jun06: On 21Jun06, the subject's medical chart was reviewed: the subject had two admissions related to this SAE.

The reporter did not specify at which site of injection the cellulitis occurred. The subject's hospitalization was extended as a result of the injection site cellulitis and the pharmacist considered the event was disabling and clinically significant (or requiring intervention) (OMIC). The subject was treated with intravenous and oral clindamycin. At the time of initial reporting, 07 November 2006, the injection site cellulitis was ongoing. The pharmacist reported that she ""does not know if the injection site cellulitis is due to the Fluarix or the Pneumovax""."

On 03-SEP-2008, the physician reported that the patient was administered her first dose of HPV vaccine and was pregnant. The patient's LMP was on 22-JUL-2008 and EDD 29-APR-2009. No adverse effect was reported. Follow-up information has been received from a physician assistant who reported thath the patient experienced spntaneous abortion on 01-OCT-2009 (appreximately 10 weeks from LMP). It was unknown if the products of conception examined. It was unknown if the fetus normal. Follow-up information has been received from a licensed practical nurse who reported that the patinet had gotten her first GARDISIL injection administered on 01-AUG-2008 at their office. The patient reported to them that her last menstrual period was on 29-JUL-2008 (previously reported as 22-JUL-2008). There was no notation in the patient's chart of any concomitant medications or vaccines. It was noted in the patient's chart that she had a spontaneous abortion. The reporter reported that the patient had an ultrasound on 01-OCT-2008 which diagnosed the spontaneous abortion. The ultrasound results were as follows: irregular gestational sac, no embryonic pole or yolk sac seen. The reporter indicated that the patient underwent a dilation and evacuation (D&C) at a hospital. The products of conception were sent for evaluation but they did not have the results of the study because she was being followed by her OB/Gyn practice. Follow-up information has been received from a office manager of an OB/Gyn who reported that the patient went to the emergency room on 01-OCT-2008 with vaginal bleeding. And ultrasound was performed as stated above. On 05-OCT-2008 the patient was admitted to hospital for D&C as a result of an incomplete spontaneous abortion. The pathology results from the analysis were ; female trisomy %, 8 and 23. The patient was seen a few weeks later for her post operative visit and everything was within normal limits. All of the patient's PAP smears since have been within normal limits as well. Neither office had any record of susquent GARDISIL injections. No further information is available. The patient was seen in Washington hospitalAdditional information has been requested."

Previous and/or concurrent vaccination included TWINRIX; GlaxoSmithKline; intramuscular; left arm given on 30 July 2008. On 30 August 2008 the subject received 2nd dose of TWINRIX (intramuscular, left arm). At an unspecified time after vaccination with TWINRIX, the subject experienced depression, altered vision, stiff neck, light sensitive, fatigue, confusion, drowsiness, increased agitation, sweating, insomnia, headache, injection site swollen, injection site redness, muscle pain and pain. At the time of reporting the events were improved. Follow up received by the reporter nurse on 04 February 2009 stated that the subject was a 59 year-old female. Concurrent medical conditions included multiple allergies to food, ASA, and anesthetics, depression, disc herniation L3-L4, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, nasal congestion and vaginal irritation. Previous and/or concurrent vaccination included TWINRIX (GlaxoSmithKline) intramuscular left arm given on 30 July 2008. Concurrent medications included Vitamin D, FLONASE, LIPITOR, PREMARIN. On 30 August 2008 the subject received 2nd dose of TWINRIX (intramuscular, left arm). On 04 September 2008 the subject experienced severe depression, vision changes, stiff neck, fatigue and redness and swelling at the site of injection. The reporter stated that because of increased side effect experienced by the subject after 2nd dose doctor withheld the 3rd dose. The reporter nurse considered the events were disabling. Relevant test results included Rheumatoid factor, Low density lipoprotein and High density lipoprotein. At the time of reporting the events were improved. The nurse considered the events were possibly related to vaccination with TWINRIX. Because the subject experienced these events after the 2nd dose and not after the 1st dose the reporter nurse considered that these events might be a result of a suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product."

A fever began within 6- 8 hours after shots (102.5 F), sleepy and very irritable throughout the night crying hysterically on and off. His hunger is diminished although he is still eating. Tuesday he breaks out with a slight rash. Tuesday evening he has great trouble waking up. We don't hear him breathing as normal. Normally you can hear him breathe but Tuesday you can't hear him. My wife comes over to the bed and can't wake him up. It's as though he is unconscious. After running downstairs and doing everything he finally wakes up and begins to cry during feedings. Cry hysterically during feedings! He isn't latching on to his bottle as normal. Doesn't focus when looking around anymore and looks like as if he is staring around into the abyss. The following afternoon Wednesday April 15, his rash is breaking out all over. Once again we cannot wake him up. We call the doctor, and they urge us to bring him in. On the way to the doctor he falls back into his unconscious state. We can't hear him breathe. We can't wake him up! We are in a car going down the highway trying to get our son to open his eyes he does not. We can't hear him breathe. We call the doctor, they advise that we call 911 and have an ambulance come to our location. I suggest we just go to the hospital which is close by. Upon arrival at ER we explain to Doctor that he just had his shots. The chief doctor from the Children's Medical Group suggest he has an infection and recommend 3 things. 1. blood test, 2.Urine test, 3. Spinal tap. Spinal tap for Meningitis! I suggested that all these symptoms happened right after the shot and would like the doctors to consider that. They refuse to do so! They will not acknowledge that the shot could have something to do with it.

Background: Active immunization was the most important measure for controlling hepatitis B (HB) virus infection. The outcome of HB vaccination had been investigated in only a very small number of cohort studies, some of which found a number of cases of HBV infection. Material and methods: Using a design different from that of earlier studies, they have investigated the occurrence of HBV infection and clinical HB disease in individuals who had a complete HB vaccination series. Reported cases of HB/HBV infections among 1235 Health care workers (HCW) were analyzed with special regard to the question of whether or not HB vaccination had taken placed in the past. Results: 23 persons had undergone a complete vaccination series with complete documentation: 18 were non-responders (post vaccination anti - HBs < 10 IU/l), one was a low- responder (anti-HBs < 100 IU/l), and four were responders (100 IU/l). While all responders seroconverted without clinical sign of hepatitis, ten non -/ responders contracted chronic HB/HBV infection and seven contracted self limited HB. Conclusion: Vaccination should be only regarded as ""successful"", if the post-vaccination anti-HBs concentration was at least 100IU/l. It was reported that a female patient was vaccinated with three doses of RECOMBIVAX HB (lot # and manufacturer, injection route and site not reported) on unspecified dates. A"
363010-1,"I started feeling unwell on the 18th.  I was aching more than usual, and felt fatigued and weak.  By Tuesday, 9/22/09, I was suffering from severe pain and some weakness in the left arm, in the muscle where the vaccine was injected, and the injection site was surrounded by a red circle which was increasing in size.  The injection site itched badly, but when I touched it, it felt like a severe bruise.  Muscle aches continued to worsen, especially in the left hand and arm.  The feeling of fatigue worsened, and my heart was beating hard (not fast - just hard).  I felt dizzy and clumsy, and my left hand and forearm got tingly - a pins and needles sensation.  By 1:30 on 9/22/09, my right hand tingled as well.  By 2:00 p.m. on 9/22/09, I left work and went to the ER.  I was told it was probably a vaccine allergy and that I would be fine.  By the evening of 9/22/09 (around 6:00), hives started popping up all over my body and itched like mad.  Topical anti-itch creams, lotions, sprays, and powders had no effect.  Benadryl had no effect - even at a high dosage.  The hives were on my arms, legs, trunk, hands, feet, palms, and in my external woman parts.  I had some in my ears, and they were also on my neck, chest, breasts, back, pretty much every skin surface of my body.  It was the worst case of hives I've had in my life; there were countless hives grouped close together - I was blanketed with them.  They were slightly larger than the hives I usually get, but not big enough to be called giant hives.  The very worst of it was centered around the injection site, which was red-purple and itched like crazy, although it hurt to touch it.  By 9/23/09, I was on high-dose prednisone, which also had no effect.  The hives finally started to lessen by the morning of 9/25/09 and continued to fade slowly.  The itching continued, but not as bad.  It took until 9/29/09 for the hives to go away, although the scabs I had from scratching the hives off (mostly in my sleep) continued to itch until they healed.  By then I was feeling really sick, and I was tentatively diagnosed with H1N1 flu, which may be unrelated.  I think I was exposed to the flu in the clinic on the day I got the regular flu vaccine (9/15/09).  I had a fever for 12 days and was very sick, but I didn't qualify for government-funded H1N1 testing, so I decided to forego the formal test.  It's hard to say exactly where the allergic reaction ended and the H1N1 flu began, or if the onset of the flu had something to do with the reaction.  I can say with certainty, though, that the vaccine was the initial cause of the allergic reaction, especially since it started at the vaccination site.  The ER doctor told me he's seen a lot more allergic reactions to this year's flu vaccine, incidentally."

396762-1,"This case was reported by GSK Legal department and described the occurrence of ankylosing spondylarthritis in a 37-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with ENGERIX B ADULT (GlaxoSmithKline). Medical history and concurrent medications were unspecified. On 15 December 2003, the subject received 1st dose ENGERIX B ADULT (batch number ENG5408B6, right deltoid, unknown route). Less than one month after vaccination with ENGERIX B ADULT, she complained of pain on right arm. Small tumefaction at the right deltoid area was noticed. According to the reporter, tumefaction, which was painful, lasted and increased in volume. On 04 February 2004, the subject received 2nd dose of ENGERIX B ADULT (batch number ENG5566A6, unknown route and injection site). In February 2004, she complained of pain on right elbow suggesting elbow tendinopathy. X-ray and ultrasound confirmed the presence of epicondylar tendonitis. Tendinopathy was associated with flexing and extension deficiency of elbow. In April 2004, the subject complained of right hip pain associated with visual disorders like blurred vision. In May 2004, as physical therapy was not efficient, infiltration (NOS) in the right elbow was performed. In 2005, pain and almost total impaired mobility of the right elbow worsened and spread over to right wrist and shoulder, suggesting algodystrophy according to the reporter. In November 2005, after several investigations (NOS), diagnosis of algodystrophy was confirmed. Rapidly, severe pain and morning joint stiffness appeared associated to a severe amyotrophy. Joint stiffness was located on rachis, sternum, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles and feet. Later, ankylosing spondylarthritis was diagnosed. On 21 March 2006, flow cytometry was positive to HLA B27. In March 2007, the subject presented with chronic lateral epicondylitis of elbow. As elbow extension was considerably limited, a beginning of arthritis was suggested. According to the reporter previous treatments including SALAZOPYRINE, methotrexate, HUMIRA and anti-inflammatory non-steroidal drugs were not well tolerated (NOS). Corticoid treatment at progressive daily dose was planned. Treatment with anti TNF alpha would be resumed if corticoid treatment at low dose was not effective. This case was assessed as disabling. At the time of reporting the events worsened. Causality assessment was not provided."

On an unspecified date, the subject received an unspecified dose of DTaP vaccine (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided), an unspecified dose of PCV7 vaccine (NON-GSK) (unknown), an unspecified dose of Hib+HepB vaccine (Non-GSK) (unknown) and an unspecified dose of IPV (Non-GSK) (unknown). 21 days after vaccination with DTaP vaccine, Hib+HepB vaccine (Non-GSK), PCV7 vaccine (NON-GSK) and IPV (Non-GSK), the subject experienced sterile abscess. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event was unspecified. The author considered the event was probably related to vaccination with DTaP vaccine, PCV7 vaccine (NON-GSK), Hib+HepB (Non-GSk) and IPV (Non-GSK). This case has been linked to case B0739797A: same literature article. Summary of the literature article: In 2004 the Clinical Consult Case Review (CCCR) working group was formed within the CDC-funded Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network to review individual cases of adverse events following immunizations (AEFI). Cases were referred by practitioners, health departments, or CDC employees. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) searches and literature reviews for similar cases were performed prior to review. After CCCR discussion, AEFI were assessed for a causal relationship with vaccination and recommendations regarding future immunizations were relayed back to the referring physicians. In 2010, surveys were sent to referring physicians to determine the utility and effectiveness of the CCCR service. CISA investigators reviewed 76 cases during 68 conference calls between April 2004 and December 2009. Almost half of the cases (35/76) were neurological in nature. Similar AEFI for the specific vaccines received were discovered for 63 cases through VAERS searches and for 38 cases through PubMed searches. Causality assessment using the modified WHO criteria resulted in classifying 3 cases as definitely related to vaccine administration, 12 as probably related, 16 as possibly related, 18 as unlikely related, 10 as unrelated, and 17 had insufficient information to assign causality. The physician satisfaction survey was returned by 30 (57.7%) of those surveyed and a majority of respondents (93.3%) felt that the CCCR service was useful.  The author's conclusion stated that the CCCR provides advice about AEFO to practitioners, assigns potential causality, and contributes to an improved understanding of adverse health events following immunizations."

On 31 Jul 2010, the patient experienced ataxia. On 06 Aug 2010, the patient was admitted to hospital for ataxia and abnormal white matter in the periventricular areas posteriorly. On 09 Aug 2010, the patient was discharged from hospital. At the time of reporting, the patient's condition was persisting. The investigator did suspect a possible relationship between ataxia and the study vaccine. In the absence of the investigators assessment of causality, the Novartis medical safety physician provisionally assessed the event abnormal white matter as suspected to be related to the study vaccine. Follow-up received on 20 Aug 2010: The initial report was received on 11 Aug 2010 (not 12 Aug 2010 as previously reported). Follow up received on 03 Sep 2010: The MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) showed non-specific ill-defined peri-ventricular white matter signal change posteriorly, which was consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) versus leukodystrophy versus adrenoleukodystrophy. The final diagnosis for the white matter remained undetermined. Other available lab results were either negative or within normal limits. The investigator assessed the abnormal white matter as suspected to be related to the study vaccine. Follow up received on 10 Sep 2010: The investigator confirmed that the date of the varicella vaccine was 02 Jul 2010, not 07 Jul 2010.

The outcome of clinically isolated syndrome was unknown. It was unknown if the investigator considered the clinically isolated syndrome to be related to DTPa-HBV-IPV vaccine and Hepatitis B vaccine. Additional information received: This case was reported in a literature article and it described the occurrence of a clinically isolated syndrome in a subject of unknown age and gender who had been vaccinated with an unspecified hepatitis B-containing vaccine (manufacturer unknown). No information on the subject's medical history, concurrent medical conditions or concomitant medication was provided.

On an unknown date after 1 January 2000, 180 days after receiving the vaccine, the subject developed a clinically isolated syndrome. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the events was unspecified at the time of reporting. The authors did not comment on any causal relationship between the vaccine and the events. The authors concluded that ""Findings from the present study show no long-term association of vaccines with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis and other central nervous system demyelinising diseases. In younger subjects, they observed a short-term increase in risk after vaccination of any type, which suggested that vaccines (like infections) could accelerate the transition from subclinical to overt autoimmunity in subjects with existing disease. The authors found no association between hepatitis B vaccination and an increased risk of multiple sclerosis or other central nervous system demyelinising diseases up to 3 years after vaccination. The results for human papillomavirus vaccine were inconclusive given the small number of cases and the paucity of previous studies on the topic. The findings reconciled the anecdotal clinical reports of a central nervous system demyelinising diseases onset shortly after vaccination with the larger body of epidemiologic literature showing no long-term increased risk of multiple sclerosis or other forms of central nervous system demyelinising diseases following vaccination. The findings do not warrant any change in vaccine policy"". This case is 1 of the 9 valid cases reported in the same literature article (see case US2014GSK053625)."

Listedness: Unlisted. Brand of vaccine not specified. Assessment according to the CCDS for CSL Inactivated Influenza Virus Vaccine and the Afluria PI, leg weakness is unlisted. Causality: Unassessable. Although there is a temporal association to event onset of 1 or 2 days following vaccination, causality is unassessable without evidence of neurological examination and or investigation. Transient ischemic attack is a possibility but unlikely to have mechanistic association with vaccination. Of note patient was on several concomitant drugs which suggest history of cardiovascular disease. Overall there is insufficient information to causally attribute event to vaccination."

According to the article: This patient was within a prospective study in a cohort of 294 patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, included in the vaccination program: seasonal flu vaccine (October to April), pneumococcal (combined regimen 13-valent and 23-valent) and Haemophilus influenzae B. Patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for infections, especially respiratory type. Immunization is a recommended measure to reduce these complications. Among all 294 patients, only 42 were not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy: 147 were treated with DMARD'S (Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs) and 98 were with TNFa inhibitor. Regarding the ARI (acute respiratory infections), before inclusion in the vaccination program, 20 (7%) patients in the cohort studied had been admitted into the hospital for this reason.

The patient had a medical history of RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. The patient's outcome was reported as Unknown. Sender's Comments: Latency is unknown in this case, we thus have no element to consider it a vaccination failure. Pneumococcal vaccine being inactivated, it cannot cause an infection. The patient had a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, his immune system may thus be weakened because of immunosuppressive therapy. Exact latency, concomitant medication including immunosuppressive therapy and additional information on patient's immune status at the time of vaccination is necessary to assess the case."

The healthcare professional considered the events were disabling and clinically significant (or requiring intervention). At the time of reporting the events were worse. The healthcare professional considered the events were possibly related to vaccination with ENGERIX B. On 05 November 2009, the nurse reported that three subjects of ten total who were given ENGERIX B at the clinic on the vaccination date (03 November 2009) had called and reported similar events. As a result of these three reports, she had decided not to use the remaining doses until she further researched these events. The immunization series was discontinued. (Please see Case A0815433A and A0815453A for more details on the other two subjects, and A0815870A on a fourth subject). Follow up information was received on 06 November 2009. The health care professional wanted to file a QA (quality assurance) report. She received 20 ENGERIX vials in October 2009. She had distributed six of these vials and four subjects developed severe reactions to the vaccinations. She felt that these vaccines had a quality issue and she will not use the rest of the vials from this lot/shipment. She had the vaccines to return to GSK for investigation."
379488-1,"This case was reported by a physician and described the occurrence of increase in liver values in a 44-year-old male subject who was vaccinated with TWINRIX (GlaxoSmithKline). Initially it was reported that the physician excluded a ""natural hepatitis infection"". Follow-up was received by the physician on 2 February 2010, including a questionnaire and a Targeted Follow Up Questionnaire. According to the questionnaire, there was no concurrent medical condition or any other risk factors. On an unspecified date the subject received unspecified dose of TWINRIX (unknown route and application site). The subject was not vaccinated by the reporting physician. Immunization course was completed. On an unspecified date in December 2009, at an unspecified time after vaccination with TWINRIX, the subject experienced increase in liver values. A blood test on 9 December 2009 showed Alanine aminotransferase value of 69 U/l, Aspartate aminotransferase 56 and Gamma GT 68. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. On an unspecified date in January 2010, the event was resolved. According to the Targeted Follow Up Questionnaire, liver enzymes or bilirubin were elevated. Symptoms did not include pain in right upper quadrant, abdominal pain, fever, confusion, nausea, jaundice, anorexia or other symptoms. Diagnostic imaging tests were not performed. A liver biopsy was not performed. Laboratory tests were not performed. Serology for Hepatitis A, B, and C was not performed. The patient had no close contact with a person with active hepatitis. None of the following diseases were known in medical history: right-sided heart failure, prior liver disease (Hepatitis A, B, C or cirrhosis), Gilbert's disease, autoimmune disease (please specify), active gallbladder disease (cholangitis or cholecystitis), active pancreatitis, alcohol use, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use, intravenous drug use, acetaminophen consumption in patients with chronic alcohol exposure.

380255-1,"This case was reported by a healthcare professional and described the occurrence of decreased therapeutic response in a 48-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with ENGERIX B (GlaxoSmithKline). There were no concurrent medications. On 5 September 2008, 3 October 2008 and 9 January 2009 the subject received 1st dose, 2nd dose and 3rd dose of ENGERIX B (20 mcg/mL, left deltoid). On 9 January 2009, the subject experienced drug dose administration interval too short. On 20 February 2009, 42 days after vaccination with the third dose of ENGERIX B, the subject experienced decreased therapeutic response. On 20 February 2009, hepatitis B surface antibody was low at 2.2. A product complaint was associated with this report. Reporter states that 5 out of 6 subjects who received dose one from the same lot, dose 2 from the same lot, and dose 3 from the same lot experienced this adverse event. The subjects received the doses on a 0, 1, and 4 month schedule. The reporter did not believe there were any physical problems with the vaccines, but was questioning the quality and content of the vaccines. This reporter felt strongly that there was something potentially wrong with one of these vaccine lots because so many subjects did not become seroprotected. This is something she has not seen and she gives these vaccinations on a routine basis. Reporter believes a quality assurance problem caused the adverse event. Please see A0778216A, A0778217A, A0778218A and A0778220A. Follow-up information was received on 14 May 2009 from Quality Assurance. Per the Quality Statement: ENGERIX vaccine lot numbers AHBVB703AA, AHBVB584AA AND AHBVB670AA met the requirements of Quality Assurance's specifications and the batches were suitable for vaccination purposes."

The patient had no relevant medical history.  No information was provided about prior exposure.  Seven days after she had received the vaccine, the patient presented with a 2 day history of symmetric multiple erythematous -oedematous papules on the extremities that enlarged gradually into target lesions.  There was no evidence of mucosal involvement, fever or respiratory symptoms, although mild arthralgias were presented.  She had received no medications before the onset of her cutaneous eruption and she had no history herpes simplex virus infection.  Due to clinical suspicion of erythema multiforme (EM), a punch biopsy was taken from the elbow on an unspecified date.  This histology showed dermal oedema, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate and interface dermatitis, with vacuolar damage and necrotic keratonocytes.  The histopathological features were consistent with lesion of erythema multiforme (EM).  Complete analysis were within normal limits.  Viral serological tests (HSV-1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, enterovirus) and a serological test for mycoplasma pneumoniae were all negative.  A diagnosis of EM was made on the basis of the clinical presentation and histology.  The absence of a history of herpes virus infection or any other cause of EM and the temporal relationship with GARDASIL suggested that the cause of EM was the GARDASIL vaccine.  The patient was treated with a low dose of oral cortiosteroids and oral antihistamines, and all of her lesions resolved completely and without scarring in a few days.  This case was considered as serious with other medically important condition as criteria (erythema multiforme).

Verbatim form the abstract: ""Background: Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine was not licensed for use in adults aged greater than or equal to 65 years due to lack of sufficient efficacy and safety data. Objective: To characterize reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) among adults aged greater than or equal to 65 years who received Tdap vaccine 'off-label' to assess for potential vaccine safety concerns. Methods: We searched VAERS for reports of adverse events (AEs) in subjects aged greater than or equal to 65 years who received Tdap vaccine from 9/1/2005 to 9/08/2010. Medical records were requested for all reports coded as serious (death, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, permanent disability, life-threatening illness). Proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was used to assess for higher proportionate reporting for AEs after Tdap compared with Td reports in subjects aged greater than or equal to 65 years. Results: VAERS received 243 reports following Tdap administered to persons aged greater than or equal to 65 years. Eleven (4.5%) reports were serious, including two deaths. Most common AEs were local reactions in 100 (41.2%) reports. Seventy-eight (32.1%) reports contained coding terms that denoted inappropriate administration of vaccine. 'Cough' was the only term associated with disproportionately higher reporting after Tdap compared with Td. Six of seven Tdap reports containing the term 'Cough' were non-serious. Clinical review of serious reports identified no unusual patterns of AEs. Conclusion: Our VAERS review of the 'off-label' use of Tdap vaccine in adults greater than or equal to 65 years did not find any safety concerns that warrant further study. These data will provide useful baseline information to assist CDC and FDA with monitoring efforts as permissive recommendations for Tdap in older persons are adopted."" A 70-year-old female patient had received Tdap (manufacturer, lot number, route, site and date of administration not reported) and an unspecified amount of time later, experienced encephalitis. No further information was available at the time of the report. The patient's outcome was not reported. Documents held by sender: None."
447409-1,"Initial information has been received from a published literature article. The authors reported that ""It is not known how long children with Hib vaccine (manufacturer unknown) failure retain protective Hib antibody levels after infection. This study aimed to determine anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) antibody concentrations in children several years after Hib infection and to identify risk factors for low antibody levels. The method used by the authors was that ""the families of foreign children with Hib vaccine (manufacturer unknown) failure diagnosed between 1992 and 2005 were asked to complete a questionnaire and a blood sample was obtained from the child"". The results were: Of 323 families approached, 260 (80.5%) returned a completed questionnaire and 175 (54.2%) children provided a blood sample. The median age at follow-up was 8.4 years (IQR 6.2-15.4 years) and median follow-up time was 4.1 years (IQR, 3.5-9.7 years). Twenty seven children (16.1%) had been born prematurely and/or had underlying disease and eighteen (10.8%) had immunoglobulin deficiency. The median anti-PRP antibody concentration was 0.70 ug/ml (IQR 0.22-5.8 ug/ml). Overall, 95 children (56.9%) had anti-PRP levels <1.0 ug/ml, while 27 (16.2%) had anti-PRP levels <0.15 ug/ml. All three children with Down's syndrome and 42% (10/24) of children aged <5 years at follow-up had Hib antibody levels < 0.15 ug/ml. An antibody level < 0.15 u/ml was independently associated with underlying conditions, young age at Hib disease and shorter time interval between Hib disease and follow-up. The authors concluded that ""over half the children with Hib vaccine (manufacturer unknown) failure had antibody concentrations below those considered to confer long-term protection, suggesting that they might be at further risk and so benefit from another dose of Hib conjugate vaccine. Follow up information has been received from another published literature article. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of immunoglobulin deficiency in children with Hib vaccine (manufacturer unknown) failure several years after developing invasive Hib disease and to determine the risk of serious infections in those who were found to be immunoglobulin deficient. This case concerns 46 cases presented with epiglottitis. Briefly, 388 children with Hib vaccine (manufacturer unknown) failure diagnosed between October 1992 and December 2005 were identified through national surveillance. The families of 9 children who had died of the Hib infection were excluded from the study, as were 55 families who could not be located (n = 42), had moved abroad (n = 2), or whose General Practitioner (GP) did not respond to the invitation letter (n = 1) or had considered it inappropriate to contact the family because 4 children with malignancy had relapsed recently, 2 had parents with psychiatric problems, 2 were in foster care, 2 had suffered a recent family tragedy and 1 had died of an unrelated illness. Therefore, 323 families received an invitation letter to participate in the study, which involved completion of a questionnaire by a parent or legal guardian and obtaining a blood sample from the child. A serious infection was defined as any infection considered to be severe enough to warrant hospital admission, as recalled by the children's parents. Of 323 families approached, a blood sample was collected from 175 (54.2%) children and 170 samples provided sufficient sera for immunoglobulin measurement. There was no difference in age at Hib disease, gender, ethnicity, geographic location, presence of underlying conditions or clinical presentation between children who provided a blood sample and those who declined (data not shown). The median ages at Hib disease and follow-up were 2.3 (IQR, 1.3-3.8) years and 8.4 (IQR, 6.2-12.0) years, with a median duration of follow-up of 4.2 (IQR, 3.5-9.7) years, equivalent to 1035 child-years of follow-up after the episode of Hib disease.

529313-1,"Case received from SPMSD under reference number: E2014-03446. Case was received from a consumer or other non health care professional via other company (SSI, ref. 0107498) and the Health Authorities on 14-Apr-2014 under the reference DK-DKMA-ADR 22499493. The case is medically confirmed as medical records had been available during the PIC case evaluation. A 3-month-old male patient (weight and height not reported) with no medical history reported received the first dose of ACTHIB (batch no. not reported) and the first dose of DI-TE-KI-POL (SSI, batch no. not reported) via not reported route and site of administration on 09-May-2012. Patient Insurance replied back to the patient's mother's notification of compensation for her son's vaccination with DI-TE-KI-POL/ACT-HIB on 16-Jul-2012. Decisions: The patient's injury in the form of itchy nodules and aluminum allergy was covered by the Act. The patient got compensation for pain and suffering. Facts: The mother applied for compensation because her son got nodules and severe itching corresponding to the vaccination sites shortly after the 5-month vaccination. He had undergone a patch test by a dermatologist, which showed aluminum allergy. He had been treated with hormone creams. Patient's compensation was based on the mother's notification, medical record and other information subjected to the following events: As part of the general child immunization program the son was vaccinated with the second dose of DI-TE-KI-POL/ACT-HIB on 16-Jul-2012 as well. The patient had undergone the 1-year examination on 20-Feb-2013. Wound formation was observed and the skin was thickened in the area where he had been previously vaccinated. It was stated in the record, that after 3- and 5-month vaccinations he had persistent problems with itching. He was referred to the dermatologist. On 30-Apr-2013 the patient was investigated by the dermatologist. In the medical record the appearance of two small lumps on the front of the left thigh was described. The skin over was slightly dry. Patch tests showed aluminum allergy. The doctor wrote a prescription for BETNOVAT. The patient had his third vaccination on 22-May-2013. During a control at the dermatologist on 19-Dec-2013. The patient had his third vaccination on 22-May-2013. During a control at the dermatologist on 19-Dec-2013 the patient was still bothered by itching. During the consultation he scratched the legs. There was still a small nodule on the skin of the left thigh front. Reasoning: Patient Insurance had assessed that the patient's development of itchy nodules and aluminum allergy was predominantly likely caused by vaccination DI-TE-KI-POL/ACT-HIB. Patient Insurance had emphasized that nodule was a known but rare adverse reaction of DI-TE-KI-POL/ACT-HIB. Patient Insurance had also emphasized that there was relation between the vaccination site and nodule formation. Patient Insurance had estimated that the damage in the form of itchy nodules and aluminum allergy goes beyond what the patient should reasonably tolerate by vaccination with DI-TE-KI-POL/ACT-HIB. Patient Insurance had put weight on that the patient at the time of injury was healthy and vaccinated as part of the chilidhood vaccination program to prevent possible diseases. Patient Insurance had also emphasized that the patient developed nodules after each vaccination and that he had been bothered by itching. At the time of reporting, the patient had not yet recovered."

The subject's medical history included recurrent atypical Haemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) and 3 renal transplants (the 3rd in February 2008). She also had a known factor H mutation as a concurrent condition. Her concomitant medications included immunosuppressive therapy with basiliximab, prednisolone, mycophenolic mofetil and tacrolimus. To prevent recurrence of HUS, she was treated with plasma exchange but it was substituted by eculizumab twice a week due to allergic reactions to plasma constituents. No further informatoin on her medical history, concurrent medical conditions or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the subject received 1st dose of MENCEVAX for prophylaxis (unknown route and injection site, batch number not provided). The subject received a second vaccination with MENCEVAX (5 months after the event, unknown route and injection site, batch number not provided), a dose of MENACTRA (Sanofi Pasteur, ACYW135) 12 months later, and an unspecified tetanus-toxoid, pneumococcal polysaccharide and influenza vaccine (doses, routes and injection site unknown; batch numbers not provided). 18 months after vaccination with MENCEVAX, the subject experienced sudden headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Upon examination, the subject was also hypotensive (blood pressure 60/40 mmHg), tachycardic (pulse 120 bpm) and had body temperature increased to 38.8 Deg. C. The subject was diagnosed with meningococcal sepsis caused by serotype W135. This case was considered as a vaccination failure. The subject was hospitalised and was treated with aggressive resuscitation and empiric antibiotics. The subject's serum IgG antibodies against meningococci had been tested twice: 2 and 16 months after the initial vaccination, and while she had low titers of serotype C antibodies she did not have serotype A, Y and W135 antibodies. The second and third meningococcal vaccine did not elicit any significant rise in antibiotics against any of the meningococcal serotypes either. The subject also failed to mount humoral responses after the tetanus-toxoid, pneumococcal polysaccharide and influenza vaccinations. The outcome of the meningococcal sepsis and its clinical manifestations was full recovery at an unknown date. The outcome of the impaired response to vaccination was unspecified. The authos did not comment on any causal relationship between the event and the vaccination. The authors' conclusion stated that ""administration of eculizumab in subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapy could be complicated by meningococcal disease despite prior vaccination. It was advised not to rely on efficacy of meningococcal vaccines in eculizumab-treated subjects receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Preferably, these subjects should be vaccinated prior to initiation of immunosuppression therapy. Furthermore, they should be readily treated with antibiotics as soon as suspicion of meningococcal disease arises and/or chemoprophylaxis with ciprofloxacin should be considered"". This case is 1 of the 2 valid cases reported in the same literature article (see case B1021327A)."

646453-1,"In September 2015, patient took the HPV virus vaccination and the changes began. Please read the story and Pray for patient!  Patient is my granddaughter and her Mother feels it is now time for everyone to see and know what has been happening to her daughter - patient has now had 5 of these episodes since February 2016 and has been to family doctors, hospitals, ER's, Neurologist, NeuroSurgeons, had MRI's, Cat Scans, Brain Wave test, etc with no conclusive answer. At first the doctors said she could possibly be faking, then it's epilepsy, then it's migraines, now it's Chiari Malformation. The doctors cleared patient to do anything she felt like doing with adult supervision. So, on Sunday July 31, 2016 she was running in a track meet with her Mom, coaches, medical staff, etc in attendance, when one of these episodes happened. Up until this time the doctors had not been able to see what was happening to patient when one of the episodes came on - her coach told her Mom on Sunday get this on video!! I have patient - take the videos!!!! Patient was taken to the ER and they found nothing wrong except her potassium was low but should not have caused anything like what you see on this video!! All her vitals were NORMAL - no heat exhaustion, no heat stroke, Nothing!!! Videos have been sent to her doctors and we are waiting on appointments to become available!!  Her mother has done hours of investigation into all aspects of possible causes and truly believes that patient is having a reaction to taking the HPV virus vaccination. That is the only answer left!!! Now she waits and watches for any sign from patient that it is happening again!! Please pray for patient and her family!!!"

151649-1,"It was reported in the Pediatric Anaesthesia journal that a child presented to his general practitioner with a 5 hours history of fever, malaise, unwillingness to take oral fluids and stridor. An examination of his throat was carried out and a dx of pharyngitis was made. He was sent to the hospital where he was found to be tachycardic and distressed. He had a temperature of 38 degrees C. The birth, developmental, drug and family history were unremarkable. A provisional dx of laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis (LTB) was made with croup score of 7, and he was transferred to the pediatric ward for observation. There he received one dose of nebulized budesonide. Over the next 2 hours, he became progressively more tachypneic and distressed. He was transferred to ICU and received 5 mg nebulized adrenaline prior to transfer. Upon arrival at ICU, examination revealed an alert but distressed child who was pyrexial (38 C). Inspiratory stridor was present but the pt had no preference for a particular position and had no drooling. Within 15 minutes of transfer to ICU, there was an obvious increase in respiratory effort and intubation was considered necessary. An oxygen and halothan induction was undertaken with standard monitoring. At the time of intubation, it was noticed that the epiglottis was enlarged, inflamed and similar to the classical cherry red appearance associated with acute epiglottitis. The remaining period of the child's ICU stay passed without incident and he wan extubated 2 days later. Dx of HIB was confirmed. The child was sent home 5 days after the admission. His immunological status was later confirmed to be normal. The authors indicated that it is also important to be aware that organisms other than HIB may cause epiglottitis on children. Group A B Hemolytic streptococcus has been cited in a number of cases. We therefore feel it is important to highlight, in the anesthetic literature, that immunization against HIB does not rule out acute epiglottitis. No further information is available.   Follow-up information indicated that the pt received treatment with Act Hib and not Pedvax Hib as previously reported. The report will be deleted from our database, as there was no adverse event following vaccination with the Merck product."

276720-1,"It was reported in a published article, title as stated above that on an unspecified date a male child was vaccinated with a first dose of MMR II (manufacturer unknown). Subsequently, on an unspecified date following vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with autism. Unspecified medical attention was sought. It was reported that the patient did not received a second dose of MMR II. No outcome was reported. The authors concluded, ""so little is still known about the opinions of parents caring for children with autism, illustrates how limited the scope of the research on the autism/MMR II controversy has been . This research has highlighted the considerable negative impact that the MMR II controversy had had on this group of vulnerable parents. This has implications for health professionals, who need to be particularly aware of the issues these parents face in future MMR II decision-making for their affected child and younger siblings. In general, these parents, perhaps more than most, face a particularly difficult decision when trying to decide whether vaccination is their child's best interests. Health professionals also need to be sensitive to the fact that some of these parents may feel in part responsible for having sanctioned an intervention that they believe may have contributed to their child's autism. More generally, there is a need to promote a greater awareness of the important role health visitors can play in parental decision-making and for research examining whether professionals feel they receive sufficient training in communication skills. Upon internal review, autism was determined to be an other important medical event. This is one of several reports received from the same source. No further information is expected. A copy of the published article is attached as further documentation of the patient's experience."

Additional information has been requested.  08/03/07 Email to FDA/CDC: Spoke w/the reporter on this case who is quite upset that it has been mistakenly reported as a Death.  The reporter is a pathologist who had received a biopsy of the nodule.  She stated she called Merck just to ask a question as to whether granulomas at the injection site had occurred during clinical trials.  She emphatically stated that this patient did not die & she will not provide name/dob or any additional information.

Case closed as incomplete as no further information provided.  Case will be reopened should additional information become available. Initial and follow-up information has been received from a pathologist and authors of a published literature article concerning a 26 year old woman who was presented for an evaluation of a tender subcutaneous nodule on the outer aspect of her left upper arm which was presented for approximately 1 month. Two months before presentation the patient had received the third vaccination of the quadrivalent GARDASIL (in a series of 3) in that area. The patient's previous medical history was non contributory. Her surgical history included an appendectomy 1 years before which was complicated by pelvic peritonitis and exploratory laparatomy. Interstingly microscopic examination of her appendix demonstrated acute appendicitis with multiple opitheloid mural granulomas. Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) and Acid-Fast bacteria (AFS) stains were negative for organisms. After surgery she developed spreading scars at the site of her appendictomy and laparatormy incisions and a work-ip with medical gentics was initiated. Both she and her brother were noted to have high arched paltes and joint laxity. Taken together, it was believed that she has a poorly characterized, mild forms of EHLERS-DANIOS syndrome. Physical examination revealed an exquisitely tender subcutaneous nodule measuring 1.3 cm. Clinically the lesion was suspected to be a hemangioma, arteriovenous malformation or panniculitis. The nodule was excised to the level of subcutaneous fat and sutured without incident. Routine histopathologic analysis demonstrated subcutaneous tissue containing numerous large area of necrosis surounded by pallisaede epitheloid histiocytes with oval nuclei and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm containing abundant violaceous/gray granular material. Histiocytes containing this violaceous granular material were abundant and arranged in sheets around the central foci of necrosis. These intracytoplasmic granules were diastase resistant periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive. Around the histiocytic sheets there was a rim of lymphoid cells and fibrosis. Multinucleated giant cells were rare and polarizable material was not detected. No organisms were seen using special stains for microorganisms, including diastase-PAS, GMS, Gram, Fite, AFS, and Steiner stains.

Patient still experiences breakouts as recently as two weeks ago. Follow-up Information 04-Sep-2008: I am writing to update my daughter's symptoms. She has continuous hive/type rash breakouts on her face and left arm. Her face will be red and swollen and her lips get puffy. In January 2008, she went to the emergency room and, as several times before, she was given IV medication and Benadryl. In July 2008, she was at the emergency room twice in three days became of insect bites that were swollen and red and also spread to the size of a small plate on her leg. The doctor and a couple of his colleagues had never seen anything like it. He outlined the bite to make sure it didn't spread. Each time, my daughter had been outside no longer than ten minutes and was the only one to have such a reaction. In August 2008, she returned to the emergency room with swollen, red palms of her hands and soles of her feet, which were very painful with a burning sensation. Seven doctors examined my daughter and were baffled. They decided to test her for everything possible. The test results were negative and the symptoms lasted for three to four days. Also, my daughter was given antibiotics to treat the insect bites and the hands/feet episode. I am very concerned that the Gardasil vaccine may have changed my daughter's metabolism especially since she is allergic to sulfur drugs, and the vaccine has a sulfur ingredient, and the vaccine was improperly administered by being given to my daughter two months too soon (the third injection). Please feel free to contact me at any time. I appreciate your attention to this matter."

Concurrent medical conditions included asthma and psoriasis. Concurrent medications included VENTOLIN, SYMBICORT, LANSOPRAZOLE, Steroid tablets and various steroid creams. On an unspecified date (reported as two weeks before vaccination with PANDEMRIX, the subject had received unspecified dose of INFLUENZA vaccine which caused a milder reaction. On 14 November 2009 the subject received unspecified dose of PANDEMRIX H1N1 (1 injection). On 14 November 2009, at an unknown time after vaccination with PANDEMRIX H1N1, the subject experienced a sore arm. 20 minutes later she also experienced generalized joint aches. Approximately 1 hour later she had stomach cramps and felt generally unwell. The subject went to bed but awoke with severe aching across the shoulder blades. The subject also experienced very bad wheezing due to asthma and cramp on the left hand side of the chest. She reported that that this asthma attack was unusual in the speed of onset and severity. It did not clear after 7 doses of VENTOLIN and SYMBICORT and necessitated a paramedic, nebulizer and a trip to casualty to completely bring the situation under control. The regulatory authority that the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention). At the time of reporting the outcome of the events were unspecified. The PANDEMRIX injection was given on Sat 14.11.09 at 11.40. The reaction started with a sore arm and 20minutes later generalized joint aches. 1 hour later had stomach cramps and felt generally unwell. I went to bed to try to recover and at 5pm I awoke with severe aching across the shoulder blades, at which point i got out of bed to go to another room but before iI got there I had an onset of very bad wheezing due to asthma, cramp on the left hand side of the chest and desperate need for the VENTOLIN. This asthma attack was unusual in the speed of onset and severity, and did not clear after 7 doses of VENTOLIN, my SYMBICORT 400 and necessitated a paramedic, nebulizer and a trip to casualty to completely bring the situation under control. 2 weeks before I had the SEASONAL FLU jab which caused a slightly milder reaction, e.g. 7 doses of VENTOLIN, out of hours doctor and nebulisation, but after talking with the doctor I decided to go ahead with the SWINE FLU jab as the doctor thought it may be coincidence and the risk of catching the SWINE FLU made having the injection more important than a possible side effect. After having a possible reaction yesterday to the SWINE FLU vaccine I believe there is too much coincidence so have filed a report, as on the whole my asthma is classed as mild, however when I appear to come into contact with the above vaccine I seemed to be having difficulties, so would like to have this registered in case someone has a reaction similar to mine who has asthma which is more severe, in the hope that steps can be put in place to support them."

386480-1,"Information has been received from a published article. The authors reported that several congenital diseases can cause recurrent meningitis, including immunodeficiency and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Mondini dysplasia, and inner ear malformation with cochlear dysplasia, can also be accompanied by CSF leakage, which occasionally causes recurrent meningitis via the auditory tube. The authors reported the case of a girl with Mondini dysplasia who experienced three episodes of pneumococcal meningitis despite undergoing definitive operation and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination. On 27-JUN-2005, the 3-year-old-girl was admitted to hospital with a 10 day history of fever, otalgia and headache. She had been diagnosed with right hearing loss in auditory brainstem response as a neonate due to Mondini dysplasia, and had experienced recurrent otitis media since then. Temperature on admission was 38.4 C. Her consciousness level was somnolence, and marked neck stiffness and a positive Kerning sign were noted. Laboratory tests were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC), 21.1 X 109/L with 91% neutrophils; C-reactive protein (CRP), 26.9 mg/dL; IgG, 874 mg/dL; and IgG2, 192 mg/dL. CSF findings were initial pressure 110 mmH2O, total leukocyte count 960/3 mL (segmented neutrophils 896/3 mL), and glucose 1 mg/dL. Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) with mutations of three PEP genes (pbpla + 2x + 2b) and serotype 19F were detected in the CSF. Blood culture also yielded growth of PRSP. Administration of antibiotics (meropenem and ceftriaxone (CTRX), immunoglobulins and dexamethasone were started for the PRSP meningitis. A second CSF culture 3 days after admission was negative, and laboratory findings showed improvement, but the low-grade fever and elevated CRP had not resolved. High-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone indicated a hypoplastic cochlea in the right ear, and opacification of the right middle ear and mastoid space. The presence of CSF leakage was suspected, and the authors considered that otolaryngeal surgery was necessary. Transcanal tympanotomy was performed at a pediatric hospital, and the right middle ear was obliterated and plugged with bone chip, bone pate and temporal muscle at 73 days after onset. CSF leakage from the hypotympanum was confirmed during surgery. The patient presented again 1 month later, however, with high fever, headache, vomiting and neck stiffness. Laboratory examination findings were as follows (on 13-SEP-2005): WBC, 14.9 x109/L, with 89% neutrophils; CRP, 1.4 mg/dL; leukocyte count in CSF, 15,000/3 mL (segmented neutrophils count 10,500/3 mL). Although blood cultures were negative, PRSP with the same genotype and serotype as on first admission was cultured from the CSF. Antibiotics were started immediately but the high fever continued, and PRSP in the CSF culture remained positive for 7 days. in spite of a change in antibiotics (CTRX to vancomycin), no effect was obtained. Because recanalization of the CSF leakage was suspected, antrotomy was performed on the 37th day. The operative findings showed almost complete absorption of the inserted materials in the middle ear. As a definitive operation, the auditory ossicle was removed and the inner ear was obliterated and plugged completely. Soon after the operation (on approximately 05-DEC-2005), the patient was inoculated with the PNEUMOVAX. Ten months later (05-OCT-2006), however, at the age of 4 years and 11 months, the patient again developed high fever, otalgia, and headache. Although the blood cultures were negative, a different serotype of PRSP, namely 6B, having the same mutations of the PBP gene, pbpla +2x + 2b, was recognized. The fever resolved immediately with the administration of antibiotics. A high titer of IgG2 antibody to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides of 141ug/mL was confirmed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gave no indication of recanalization of the CSF leakage, and it was confirmed that the ri"

Concurrent medical conditions included asthma, cat allergy, egg allergy, house dust allergy and pollen allergy. On 21 December 2010, the subject received unspecified dose of FLUARIX (parenteral, right arm), lot number not provided. On 21 December 2010, less than one day after vaccination with FLUARIX, the subject experienced right upper arm petechiae with swelling of right upper extremity and severe redness of the whole right upper extremity. The subject visited an outpatient where he was treated with POLARAMINE. The physician considered the symptoms might be caused by an allergic reaction. On 23 December 2010, the subject was hospitalised due to the severe redness of the whole right upper extremity and the swelling of the arm including fingers and hand. The laboratory test showed c-reactive protein 36 mcg/L. The ultrasound of the right arm showed no indication of the deep vein thrombosis. The subject was treated with 1 dose of BETAPRED and Ampicillin. At the time of reporting the events were improved. The regulatory authority reported that the events were probably related to vaccination with FLUARIX. Although the incident was very distressing for the subject, it was perceived as very serious and did not constitute a real contraindication to repeated use of the same vaccine. However, the indication should be carefully considered before the next vaccination, since there is a risk of repetition of the same symptoms on subsequent use of the same type of vaccine."

The patient was treated with ethinylestradiol + Gestodene (per os; indication: menorrhagia) since 17-AUG-2009 and etonogestrel (subcutaneous) since March 2011. Four days after the vaccine administration, she experienced severe headache which subsided after the administration of analgesic drugs. On 06-SEP-2011, at about 8:00 PM, she had an episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure, lasting about 45 minutes and she was hospitalised on that day at the intensive care unit. With Glasgow 5 she was intubated and ventilated. C-reactive Protein result was 1.8 mg/dl, without other changes. Pharmaceutical products and drugs dosages in urine were negative. Brain CT-Scan showed no reported change. Cranial vein MRI results showed thrombosis of the distal left transverse sinus extending to the sigmoid sinus upper part of the ipsilateral jugular vein. She began treatment with enoxaparin (subcutaneous) and there was progressive improvement in neurological status. Currently, she had Glasgow 15, with no focal deficits and a summary examination unchanged. Results from the pro-thrombolytic study conducted (September 2011) showed functional protein C decrease at 53% and anti-thrombine III decreased. It was reported that the drug ethinylestradiol + gestodene was suspended due to the reaction. The adverse event reversed after drug suspension. Treatment of specific reaction with analgesia, hospitalization in intensive care unit; assisted ventilation and subcutaneous enoxaparin. The adverse event regressed with treatment. The patient was discharged on 15-SEP-2011 with the following consequences: paresthesia of limb and face, decrease in strength in the left leg and anterograde memory impairment. The outcome was recovering. There was no reduction in dosage. There was suspicion of drug-drug interaction. New drug interacting: subcutaneous implant of etonogestrel from March 2011 to September 2011. The same drug had not been reintroduced. No known prior reactions to these or other drugs. Administration dates of the interacting drug vaccine against GARDASIL were reported: D1 administered on 19-JAN-2011 and D2 on 04-APR-2011. To be noted that the patient's mother suffered a stroke at 48 years of age. The patient smoked 10 cigarettes per day.

To be noted that HA coded medication error which was supposed to be in relation with concomitant use of ethinylestradiol + gestodene, etonogestrel, since vaccination schedule for GARDASIL was consistent with the recommendation and no contra-indication to-vaccine was noted. It was noteworthy that after case analysis this case was suspected to be a duplicate of case E201105457 since the narrative referred to a patient with the same sex and age; the dates of the suspected vaccine administration were the same (D3); the onset dates of the AE were similar to the reported date and the same AE. However, no confirmation on the initials and or birth date of the patient could be obtained. The events were considered by health authority to be an other important medical events. Other business partner numbers included: E2011-06023. No further information was reported."
438470-1,"This case was reported by a physician via regulatory authority (NL-LRB-127307) and described the occurrence of cellulitis in a 3-year-old male subject who was vaccinated with INFANRIX-IPV (GlaxoSmithKline). Concomitant medication was not reported nor known medical history. The patient had no known past drug therapy. On 25 July 2011, the subject received 5th dose of INFANRIX-IPV (intramuscular, unknown injection site, batch number not provided). On 25 July 2011 in the evening, several hours after vaccination with INFANRIX-IPV, the subject experienced extensive swelling of vaccinated limb, fever, induration, erythema, painful to touch and blister like lesion at the inside of the upper arm. He could move his fingers. Swelling increased from wrist to shoulder. On 26 July 2011, one day after vaccination with INFANRIX-IPV, the subject had increasing of pain and felt unwell. He was first seen by a pediatrician who noticed that the injection was wrongly administered and the subject was treated with anaesthetic gas. He wanted to hospitalize the child but the parents did not want to. The subject was seen by another pediatrician who prescribed paracetamol and wet compresses. At the time of reporting the events were resolved. The physician reported that the events were definitely related to vaccination with INFANRIX-IPV. Follow-up information received on 4 October 2011: On 27 July 2011, 2 days after vaccination with INFANRIX-IPV, the subject experienced bullous cellulitis. The case was upgraded to serious. The subject was hospitalised for one night. On admission, he was alert, anxious and resisting with loudly crying. No ill appearance, body temperature: 36.1 deg.C, no meningeal signs. He had edema on left upper arm, not well demarcated redness till half the lower arm. Open bullae diameter 4-5 cm at median side of left upper arm. C-reactive protein was 46 mg/l. Cultures revealed no Methylcillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nor other resistant microorganisms. On 27 July 2011, leucocyte count increased to 13x10E9/l. The subject was treated with OXACILLIN, fusidine gazes and AUGMENTIN. At the time of reporting, bullous cellulitis was improved. The physician considered bullous cellulitis was possibly related to vaccination with INFANRIX-IPV as the bullae were at the median side of the left upper arm where usually the vaccine is not injected."
453007-1,"This case was reported by a physician via a regulatory authority (PL-URPL-OCR-20120314007) and described the occurrence of unconscious in a 18-month-old male subject who was vaccinated with INFANRIX-POLIO-HIB (GlaxoSmithKline), PREVENAR 13 (non-gsk). The subject's medical history included hospitalization for convulsion and pneumonia in December 2011. Concurrent medical conditions included congenital toxoplasmosis, heart disorder, hydrocephalus and neurological disorder. The subject had a ventricular-abdominal valve. On 20 February 2012, at about 12:00, the subject received unspecified dose of INFANRIX-POLIO-HIB (intramuscular, unknown injection site), unspecified dose of PREVENAR 13 (intramuscular, unknown injection site). On 20 February 2012, 9 hours after vaccination with INFANRIX-POLIO-HIB and PREVENAR 13, the subject experienced fever (38.5-38.9 Deg. C) and somnolence. The subject was treated with ibuprofen. Later the same day, in the admission room the condition of the subject was described as severe. The infant was unconscious, experienced febrile convulsions (upper limbs and muscles), tachycardia (180/min) and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode. The subject was treated with RELANIUM and clonazepam. The convulsions yielded after 40 minutes. Clonazepam was recommended again. No more convulsions were observed, medical condition was good. The subject was hospitalised. At the time of reporting the events were resolved. In the physician's opinion, the vaccination is not the only cause of convulsion's appearance, because the subject had neurological and heart disorders and because of the fact, that previous convulsions were associated with fever. Further information was not expected."

Medical history and concurrent medications, if any, were unspecified. On unspecified dates, the subject received a 1st dose, a 2nd dose and a 3rd does of INFANRIXQUINTA (batches, routes and injection site unknown). After the first dose, the subject presented with a small nodule at injection site. After the second dose, the size of the nodule increased (coded condition aggravated). Eczema on forehead occurred on an unspecified date and resolved in an unspecified time. After the third dose, a new increased of the nodule's size was observed, associated with injection site pruritus which worsened when the subject was ill. At the time of reporting the subject was 13-month-old, nodule and pruritus at injection site were unresolved. The reporter's assessment was not provided. Follow-up information received on 17 April 2012: The subject weighed 11.5 kg and measured 86 cm at 18 months old. Medical conditions included cow's milk protein intolerance. On 04 January 2011, the subject received the first dose of INFANRIXQUINTA (batch A20CA604D, subcutaneous, left thigh). On 04 February 2011, the second dose of INFANRIXQUINTA was administered (batch A20CA659A, subcutaneous, left thigh). On 10 March 2011, the third dose of INFANRIXQUINTA was administered (batch A20CA659A, subcutaneous, left thigh). The pharmacist reported an inflammatory reaction at each injection sites with three small balls which swelled and became blue, hard, warm and visible to the naked eye, regularly, mainly during ENT affections, teething, gastroenteritis..Those nodules were associated with severe pruritus leading the subject to scratch himself until bleeding. During the most important reaction, the two nearest nodules constituted a nodule of the size of a quail's egg resulting in a severe discomfort for the subject. No corrective treatment was administered. An ultrasound scan was planned on next 02 May 2012. No information was provided about eczema after the second dose of INFANRIXQUINTA, initially reported. At the time of follow-up reporting, outcome of inflammatory reaction, nodule and pruritus at injection site were reported as worse. The pharmacist reported that the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention). The pharmacist considered the reported events as almost certainly related to vaccinations with INFANRIXQUINTA."
487814-1,"Daughter had a stroke. Patient is a previously healthy young girl who had acute onset of her right arm feeling ""funny"" with described dystonic posturing while putting clothes away in her bedroom on the morning of October 21, 2012. She suddenly started screaming for her parents and complained of her right arm feeling ""funny"". While talking to her mother, mother could not understand what she was saying and the right side of patient's face started drooping. There was history of headache and no preceding illness, fever or trauma. Family called 911 but decided to take her to the local ER even before they arrived. In the emergency room. she underwent a head CT scan (normal), CXR and ""blood work"". After about 4 hours in the ER she was transported to hospital. She was admitted to hospital and subsequently developed jerking movements of the right arm for about 2 minutes. She was alert and aware throughout this time without alteration in sensorium. An EEG (October 21, 2012) was reportedly normal. She underwent a brain MRI scan (October 21, 2012) which was distorted by brace artifact, but raised concerns for ""abnormal findings in the left cerebral cortex"" which was felt to be most suggestive of focal post ictal change, although ischemia could not be fully excluded. She was placed in the ICU and showed gradual improvement each day. She was placed on aspirin (did not receive HEPARIN). The scan was repeated at 48 hours which again showed an ""abnormality"" of the ""left cortex"" with a similar differential diagnosis. MR angiogram and subsequent CT angiogram of the circle of Willis and neck was normal. She was hospitalized for a total of 6 days. Work up for stroke (see below) was negative apart for concerns on echocardiogram for a PFO with right to left shunt (October 21, 2012) and a homozygous for MTHFR C677T on her thrombophilia evaluation (with a normal homocysteine level). Patient was seen at the clinic on November 5, 2012 by my colleague, for a second opinion regarding her suspected stroke. She was also seen by dr in pediatric cardiology and repeat contrast echocardiogram here did not show evidence of a PFO. There as no atrial shunting by 2D imaging and color Doppler. Delayed positive contrast after 4 beats was not felt to be consistent with an atrial level shun. If anything, it was felt to possibly be indicative for tiny pulmonary AVMs, but not a PFO. He felt the windows were good and that she did not require a transesophageal echo. Patient was also seen by dr in pediatric hematology for her homozygous (C677T) MTHFR mutation who recommended starting 1 mg a day of folic acid. She also recommended a rheumatology referral for a positive ANA in light of her stroke. Her anti-ENA panel and ds DNA antibodies were negative (see below). She was therefore seen by dr on November 30, 2012. Unfortunately, his note is not yet in the electronic medical record, however, per family, he was questioning reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). The reason for this is unclear in the setting of reportedly normal MRA/CTA and no history of headache. Patient received two session of occupational therapy as an patient but did so well that this was stopped. She appears to have recovered fully from her stroke without residual symptoms. Her braces were removed and a repeat brain MRI and MRA scan was done today which showed encephalomalacia and gliosis in the left perirolandic region, compatible with her history of stroke. There were no new intracranial abnormalities. MRA angiogram of the circle of Willis showed patient intracranial circulation without evidence of stenosis, aneurysm or vascular malformation. Of note, patient had received the GARDASIL vaccination on September 14, 2012. She has had the chickenpox vaccine in the past."

On 10-DEC-2012, the patient visited a nearby hospital because there was blood mixed in feces. On 15-DEC-2012, KAYTWO and TRANSAMIN were prescribed as the treatment of bloody stool. On 28-DEC-2012, the patient visited the reporting physician. Blood clots were confirmed by photographic examination and there was no abnormality in blood test, platelets count was 36.7x10000/microliter and on 04-JAN-2013 was 0.3x10000/microliter. On 05-JAN-2013, ROTATEQ, ACTHIB and PREVENAR were vaccinated for the second time. and DTP-IPV was also vaccinated. Although there was difficulty in stopping bleeding, the patient was brought home without complaint. Generalized bleeding spot appeared in the night and the patient developed thrombocytopenia. The patient was hospitalized into pediatrics department. On an unspecified date, oral corticosteroid was started as a treatment. On an unspecified date, the patient was introduced to the reporting physician's hospital from the pediatrics department. Thrombocytopenia was continuing and there was no bloody stool during hospitalization. On 18-FEB-2013, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Bloody stool was seen on 19-FEB-2013 and 17-APR-2013, and was not seen in other days. On 21-FEB-2013 platelets count was 25.4x10000/microliter and on 18-APR-2013 was 24.6x10000/microliter, occult blood was negative. On 18-APR-2013, the patient recovered from bloody stool and thrombocytopenia. Oral corticosteroid was discontinued. Test results about diagnosis: No milk allergy. Occult blood was positive. The reporting physician's comment: Invagination of intestine was denied by the symptoms. Although the primary illness was not considered to be the reason of bloody stool, the causality couldn't be denied completely because bloody stool was also seen in a distant interval time (17-APR-2013). But the possibility was considered to be little. Thrombocytopenia was thought to be adverse reaction of vaccines other than ROTATEQ. The reporting physician considered that the thrombocytopenia was serious due to hospitalization. The reporting physician considered that the bloody stool was non-serious. The reporting physician felt that the bloody stool was related to ROTATEQ. Risk factors other than ROTATEQ were unknown. The reporting physician felt that the thrombocytopenia was not related to ROTATEQ. ACTHIB and PREVENAR were considered to be the risk factors other than ROTATEQ.

On 18 October 2012, the subject received 1st dose of ROTARIX (1.5 ml, oral). In October 2012, between 2 and 3 days after vaccination with ROTARIX, the subject experienced bloody stools. The subject was hospitalised and a diagnosis of invagination of intestine was made. The subject was treated with a laparotomy. On 15 November 2012, the subject visited the reporter's hospital for the second vaccination and the onset of the invagination of intestine was confirmed through the parent's report. Surgical wound from the laparotomy and the degree of recovery from the invagination of intestine were also confirmed. Furthermore, the subject received vaccines except ROTARIX. At the time of reporting the events were resolved. The physician considered the event were related to vaccination with ROTARIX. Follow-up information received on 21 January 2014: Subject's family history did not include intussusception or bowel abnormalities. The subject had no previous intra-abdominal surgery. On 21 October 2012, 3 days after vaccination with ROTARIX, the subject experienced intermittent crying and poor suckling around noon, and had bloody stool at 16:00 and 19:00. As the subject also experienced vomiting, the subject was taken to a holiday and night-time emergency clinic and was referred to hospital. Since the ultrasound showed a target sign, enema reduction was attempted but did not succeed. The subject was referred to another hospital. Intussusception was diagnosed by air or liquid contrast enema. Enema reduction was also attempted but did not succeed. The following test were not done: plain abdominal radiograph (to show a visible intussusceptum, soft tissue mass or fluid levels and dilated bowel loops, non-specific abnormalities), abdominal ultrasound (to show a visible intussusceptum or soft tissue mass), demonstration of an intra-abdominal mass with specific characteristic features, abdominal CT scan (to show a visible intussusceptum or soft tissue mass). On 22 October 2012, the subject underwent open reduction. The lesion was reduced by the Hutchinson's procedure. The lead point was the terminal ileum, and the Peyer's patch was thickened. Intussusception extended to the splenic flexure. The vermiform appendix was as long as 10 cm with the bending tip. As circulatory failure was noted, ligation and resection of the appendicular root were performed. There were no complications of radiological procedure or surgery. On 26 October 2012, after the surgery, the subject made a good progress and was discharged from the hospital. The physician considered intussusception was related to vaccination with ROTARIX. The causal relationship of the other events was not provided. There were no suspected causative factors other than vaccination with ROTARIX."
526772-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of right abducens palsy in a 6-month-old male subject who was vaccinated with DTPa-IPV (small D + P) (manufacturer unspecified), Hib vaccine (unspecified). The authors report that the subject did not have any severe underlying pathology. No further information has been provided on his medical, family history or concomitant medication. On an unspecified date, the subject received an unspecified dose of DTPa-IPV (small D + P) (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided) and an unspecified dose of Hib vaccine (unspecified) (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided). 5 days after vaccination with DTPa-IPV (small D + P) and Hib vaccine (unspecified), the subject experienced right eye esotropia. On ophthalmological examination he had a high-grade stereopsis in his right eye with a Lang I Stereotest result of 550 seconds of arc. The author reported that the alignment was tested using either the prism cover test or the Krimsky method with a result of 12 degrees of deviation and a motility impairment of -3 (graded from -1 to -4) with the right face turn. His bilateral visual acuity was deemed normal using an unspecified preferential looking technique. He had normal anterior segments and fundus in both eyes. No information has been provided on the neurological examination and diagnostic imaging performed on the subject but the authors report that the results were normal. Diagnosis was benign abducens nerve palsy. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK. Within 6 months, the events were resolved. The subject was followed up during 28 months. He did not have any recurrence during that period. The author's conclusion state that benign abducens nerve palsy refers to cases without obvious pathology and those with less severe associations. These benign palsies may arise from viral aetiology (EBV, CMV, VZV), other infections (mycoplasma pneumonia infection, Q fever, Lyme's disease) or follow immunizations. They found infections preceding the palsies in four subjects, and an association with immunization in 1 out of 12 subjects."

528660-1,"It was reported in a published article. This literature marketed report as received from the authors refers to a female patient of unknown age. On an unknown date the patient was vaccinated with an unspecified number of GARDASIL (dose, route and lot number were not reported). Concomitant medications were not reported. This was a historical cohort study assembled by means of record linkage of several large longitudinal databases of routinely collected health data, including the immunization monitoring system and the cervical cancer screening registry (CCSR). The authors used data from administrative health databases to estimate VE against the detection of cervical dysplasia. The early introduction of the GARDASIL vaccine (in 2006) and the availability of population-based vaccination and cervical cancer screening registries provide a unique opportunity to perform this evaluation. The authors used the population registry to identify all eligible participants, defined as females >15 years old who have been registered between August 2006 and March 2010. During the enrollment period, there were 3,541 eligible females who received GARDASIL. Because of overlapping source databases, it was difficult to ascertain the exact number of administered doses in each case, but we found that approximately 13% of vaccinated females had only one recorded vaccine administration. Consistent with our intention-to-treat approach reflecting real-life vaccine use, participants with potentially suboptimal vaccination schedules were retained in the analysis. Most vaccinated females were 15 to 19 years old at the time of vaccination; only approximately 3% were 30 or older. The median length of follow-up after enrollment was 3.1 years (range, 0.1 to 5.4). Overall, the 3-year cumulative probability of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) (3.7%) and high-grade SIIS (HSIL) (2.6%) was slightly higher in the nonvaccinated cohort compared with the vaccinated cohort (3.3% and 2.3%, respectively), whereas that of ASCUS was similar (2.8%). No invasive cancers were detected in either cohort, but 12 vaccinated females (0.3%) and 22 nonvaccinated females (0.2%) had in situ cervical cancer (CIS) during follow-up. The outcome of in situ cervical cancer was not reported. Upon internal review in situ cancer of cervix was considered to be medically significant. This is one of several cases reported in the same literature article. Additional information has been requested."
528794-1,"This spontaneous report as received from a physician refers to a 14 year old female patient. According to the physician, the patient does not have any trauma, anxiety or depression history, she lives in a harmonious home. The patient's current condition reported as ""described as healthy by the physician"". On an unknown date, the patient received the first of a GARDASIL. On an unknown date, approximately in December 2013, the patient was vaccinated with the second dose of a GARDASIL 0.5 ml (lot# not available). On an unknown date, approximately in January 2014, a month after receiving the second dose, the patient experienced intense cervical pain that few weeks later was extended to arms and legs and in addition developed paresthesia in her 4 extremities and insomnia and fatigue (both approximately in 2014). The patient's symptoms prevented her to go to school. On an unknown date, a physical examination was performed; it showed a desperate adolescent because of the pain and paresthesia. According to the physician, there was an evident generalised allodynia accompanied by the 18 tender points positive for fibromyalgia. Any infection, inflammation or autoimmune disease were ruled out as cause of her symptoms. At the time of the report, three months have passed and the patient continued experiencing generalised pain and paresthesia that have disabled her. According to the reporter, the probable diagnosis was syndrome like fibromyalgia that appeared a month later (approximately in January 2014) of vaccination with GARDASIL. The outcome of paresthesia and fibromyalgia was reported as not recovered/not resolved. The outcome of generalised allodynia, fatigue and insomnia was unknown. Reporting physician considered paresthesia in all extremities and generalised pain disabling. This case is now of two from the same source reports. Additional information has been requested."
536088-1,"This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of hepatitis B by vertical transmission in an infant subject of unspecified gender who was vaccinated with HepB (manufacturer unspecified) and hepatitis B immunoglobulin. The subject and their mother were taking part in a study on the impact of maternal HIV/HBV coinfection on the vertical transmission of HIV. The subject's mother had been diagnosed with HIB/HBV coinfection during the antepartum period (HIV viral load: 17,700 copies/mL; HBsAg test positive with HBV viral load: 1,684,972,136 copies/mL). She did not receive lamivudine-containing Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) during the study. No further information regarding the subject's medical, family history or concurrent medication has been provided. At birth, the subject received HBV immunoglobulin. On an unspecified date (between August 2002 and September 2007), the subject received a course of HepB (administration site and route unknown, batch number not provided). No information has been provided regarding any clinical examinations performed on the subject. The subject underwent HIV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction testing within 48 hours of birth and during scheduled visits, testing negative for HIV infection at 12 months of age (defined as HIV-1 viral load <5000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). However, the subject was tested positive for HBV with a viral load of 934,458,295 copies/mL. Diagnosis was HBV infection with significant HBV viraemia by vertical infection transmission. This case was assessed as medically serious by GSK due to vaccination failure. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events was unspecified. The author's conclusion stated that 7 (37%) infants had detectable HBV viraemia at 6-12 months after birth as timely vaccination against HBV was not provided; however, only one infant had very high levels of viraemia, providing evidence that only one potential transmission probably occurred. This infant had documented receipt of HBV vaccine and HBV immunoglobulin. Not surprisingly, the mother of this infant also had the highest measured HBV viral load. These findings support the theory that high maternal viraemia can cause maternal-to-child transmission of HBV even if vaccination is provided in a timely manner. There is some debate about whether antepartum antiviral suppression of HBV is warranted to prevent HBV transmission to infants in addition to HBV vaccine and HBV immunoglobulin specifically for mothers with high HBV viraemia. Studies are now ongoing to evaluate the role of HAART with dual antiviral activity among HIV/HBV coinfected pregnant women with high HBV viraemia to prevent vertical transmission of HIV and HBV. In conclusion, their study identified a 4.6% prevalence of active HBV coinfection among HIV-infected pregnant women. Although limited by its small sample size, their study suggests that HIV/HBV coinfection has minimal to no significant effect on MTCT of HIV but may contribute to increased all-cause infant mortality. As HBV DNA was detected in a large percentage of pregnant women, routine antenatal HBV screening, the use of ART with dual antiviral activity among HIB/HBV-coinfected pregnant women, and the timely vaccination of HBV-exposed infants are warranted as a public health policy to prevent maternal-to-child transmission of both HIV and HBV in endemic countries."
541178-1,"This case was reported by a physician via a regulatory authority (# 2014-04184) and described the occurrence of possible erysipelas in a 4-year-old female subject who was vaccinated with INFANRIX-IPV (GlaxoSmithKline). On 30 May 2014, the subject received booster dose of INFANRIX-IPV (intramuscular, left upper arm). On 31 May 2014, 1 day after vaccination with INFANRIX-IPV, the subject experienced a massive, circular redness and swelling of the size of approximately 8 x 5 cm and pain in the left arm (vaccination arm). The subject had no itching. After 48 hours, the skin reaction reached its maximum spread with a diameter of 15 cm on the left upper arm. The regulatory authority reported that the events were clinically significant (or requiring intervention). The subject was suspect to have erysipelas and was treated for 5 days with CEDAX and ibuprofen for 3 days with local cooling. The symptoms increased much overnight and so the subject's parents consulted the hospital where the subject was treated with XYZAL, for 3 days. On 15 June 2014, the events were resolved. At the time of reporting, the subject had a residual skin discoloration from the size of 5x4 cm on the left upper arm, but no overheating, pain, local lymphadenopathy and no local induration. The regulatory authority reported that the events were probably related to vaccination with INFANRIX-IPV. No further information was expected, the regulatory authority has provided GSK with all the available information for the time being, if they ever get any further information they will send it to GSK. Therefore the case has been closed."
